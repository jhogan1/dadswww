PART I - GENERAL




          The ancient family of Fox in England, with branches in America and other countries, is of Norman-French origin.  Its name derives from the French word "renard", also spelled reinard or reynard, which translated into old Anglo-Saxon (and now modern English) means "fox".  The use of surnames was introduced into England by the Norman adventurers under William the Conqueror, in 1066, but for centuries was confined to the upper classes; however, such usage became general in Scotland about the twelfth century.  Prior to the year 1272 the name "Renard" (etc.) in England had resolved into Fox. - (See "The Norman People", page 249 - FOX.)  Some persons of the name are mentioned in early records, as follows:

In 1148 William Vulpis or Renard held lands from the Bishop of Winchester, in England.  The family continued  there as le Fox, and from it descended the Earls 	of Ilchester and Lords Holland.

          	Robert Reinard (Fox) was in Normandy (in France) in 1198.

          	Aeliz and Ranulph Renouard were in England in 1198.

          	Gilbert le Fox and others of the name were in England in 1272.

          	Turstain Renouard was in England during the time of King Henry IV (1367-		1413).


          At an early date not yet determined one branch of the Fox family settled in Buckinghamshire (Bucks County, or County Bucks), England.  Persons of the name who are mentioned in Lipscomb's "History of Buckinhamshire" were:
                                                                      
												         2



John Fox, LLB, Rector of Hedsor Parish, Desborough Hundred, from 16 December 1457 to 16 August 1459. - (Vol. 3, p. 580.)

Thomas Fox, Rector of Maids' Moreton Parish, Buckingham Hundred, during 1503-1531. - (Vol. 3, p. 43.)

John Fox, Abbot of Great Missenden Parish, Aylesbury Hundred, from 21 November 1 528 to about 1 538 . - The arms of John Fox, Abbot of Assumption of the B.V.M. (lessed Virgin Mary) of Missenden Magna, were "Argent a chevron Sable between three cocks' heads gules on a chief Azure a fox courant Or, dep;cted on a shield surtout a Crosier".  On 5 September 1534 he subscribed to the King's Supremacy, under Seal. - (Vol. 2, p. 368.) He probably was an uncle of the first known Henry Fox of Great Missenden, and later might have been Vicar of Stewkley Parish.

John Fox, Vicar of Stewkley Parish, Cotteslow Hundred, from 10 December 1545 to 4 July 1554 and from 1559/60 until the time of his death shortly before 10 April 1583. - (Vol. 3, p. 472-3.) Some historians have erroneously identified him as John Foxe the Martyrologist who died on 15 April 1587. He formerly might have been Abbot of Great Missenden Parish.  The Stewkley Parish Registers (1545-1653) contain entries relating to members of the Fox family, which persons might have been his children and grandchildren (baptized during the years of 1552-1588). He probably married in 1551 after celibacy of the clergy was rejected by the Church of England under the Reformed Faith.

PART II - ANCESTORS IN ENGLAND



         Some theories heretofore have been advanced that John Fox, the father of Henry Fox who settled in King William County, Va., was descended from or belonged to the family of one or another of the following listed persons.  While a resident (for thirty-seven years) in Washington, D. C., this writer made extensive searches in the Congres-
sional Library's collection of genealogical, biographical, and historical works published in England, for information which would determine the truth or falsity of the said theories.  These searches yielded conclusive proof that none of the listed persons was an ancestor of or a family member with the said John Fox.

              1.  Rev. John Foxe, or Fox (1517-1587). - The Martyrologist.

         2. Thomas Fox (1575-         ). -Member of the London Company, 1609-1624.

         3. John Fox (1614-        ). -Supporter of Kings Charles I and Charles II.

         4. Sir Stephen Fox (16 __-        ). -Brother of John Fox (No. 3)

         5. Richard Fox (1622-        ). -Political refugee to Virginia in 1649.  Some writers 		 have erroneously mentioned him as "Major John Fox".

         6.  Henry Fox (1705-1774). - 1st Lord Holland and father of Charles James Fox 		  (English statesman).

          In Volume 1, on page XXIV, of the heretofore mentioned History of Buckinghamshire, a pedigree chart, with illustration of arms, is shown of the family "Fox, of Great Missendenl'.  The chart was copied from the so-called "Visitation of Buckinghamshire" made in the years 1566, 1575, and 1634. In England, the Heralds' College (or College of Arms) has the duty of recording pedigrees and the granting of arms to persons who wish to assume them, and the duty of determining all claims in connection with the arms.  The Earl-marshal (head of the College of Arms) and his appointed heralds have the oversight of, and conduct, the "visitations" which are made to the individual shires (or counties) for the purpose of regulating and determining all matters connected with the use of armorial bearings.  The arms of the family "Fox, of Great Missenden" are described by Burke in his "General Armory", page 373, as follows:

Argent a chevron Sable between three cocks gules on a chief Azure a fox courant Or.  Crest:  A lion sejant  guardant Or, supporting with the dexter foot a bok of gold.

Note:  These arms were depicted in "the south window of the Chancell of the P'rish Church of  Great Missenden"; and the same arms were engraved on the tomb of the wife of the Reverend John Fox, Rector, of Ware Parish in Gloucester County, Va., as mentioned in Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1.

           The forementioned pedigree chart shows the descent of the family of "Fox, of Great Missenden" down to the year 1637. The dates of birth and marriage of the individual persons named in the chart have been estimated by this writer on the basis of some pertinent data found in contemporaneous records; and the persons indicated by the numbers 1 through 5 are identified by him as being in the direct ancestral line of
the Fox Family of Richland-Lexington County, S.C.

             l.   HENRY (b. ca. 1521) - md., ca. 1544, a Miss Hawes of Missenden and had a 	   son William. - (See 2. below. )

             2.  WILLIAM (b. ca. 1545) - md., ca. 1568, Anne Lane (daughter of Henry Lane 
               of Great Missenden) and had issue:

             	a .  Elizabeth (b. ca. 1569) - d. unmarried.

             b.  Giles (b. ca. 1570) - "Son and heire"; md., ca. 1593, ---and had two 		
	  daughters:

                 (1) Sarah (b. ca. 1594) - "Eldest daughter and coheire".
	     (2) Elizabeth (b. ca. 1596) - "Second daughter and coheire".

                   c.  Susan (b. ca. 1572) - md., ca. 1590, a Mr. Rowse of London.

d.  John (b. ca. 1573) - "Second sonne"; b. at Great Missenden; was Parson of Stretley in County Bedford; md. ca. 1600, Margaret Wetherhed (daughter of Francis Wetherhed of Cole Aston in County Bucks) and had a son:

(1)  Adoniah (b. ca. 1601, at Great Missenden; d. 1672 - will probated in London) - On 25 April 1626 Adoniah Fox of St. Sepulchre's, London,  Merchant Taylor, married Margaret Bayly (daughter and sole heir of Michaell Bayly of London) of St. Bartholomew the Less, London,  Spinster, and had issue:

(a)  John (b. ca. 1627) - "Son and heire".  He  evidently was the John Fox, Marriner (sic), of Wapping,  Middlesex County, England, who died at "Ginney" in 1658, being the Master of e vessel "Benediction".  His will (signed 24 December 1656) bequeathed his 1/3 interest in that vessel to Matthew and Edward, minor sons of Mathew ffairly/ffairlee (Fairley?).  Letters of administration were issued on 9 August 1658 to Mathew ffairlee, executor of the will, he probably also being the brother-in-law of John Fox who apparently died without issue. - (Canterbury Wills, 1657-1660,Folio 437.)

 (b)  Robert (b. ca. 1629) - "Second sonne".  He evidently was the Robert Fox, Mariner, of Wapping (in Stepney Parish), Middlesex County, England, who died in 1666. - (Canterbury Wills, 1661-1670.) He probably owned a 1/3 interest in the vessel "Benediction", as did his brother John Fox.  In 1653-1658 Captain Robert Fox was Master of the "Margaret", and in 1663-4 he was Commander of the "Humphra and Elizabeth", these vessels being employed in trade and passenger service between England and Virginia. - (Va. Mag. of H. & B., Vol. 17, 1909 , page 361, and Vol . 18 , 1910 , page 1 58 ; The York County Note Book, Vol. 3, p. 25) About 1652 he married Ann ---, both of them being mentioned in the will (dated 7 Oct. 1665; probated 24 Nov. 1665) of Richard Young, Citizen and Cooper of London, who bequeathed to  "Mr. Robert Fox, Mariner, and his wife Ann, 40 S. apiece". - (Va. Mag. of H. & B., Vol . 14, p. 172. )

(c)  Margaret (b. ca. 1631) - Probably md., ca. 1649, Mathew ffairly/ffairlee (Fairley?) and was the mother of sons Matthew and Edward named in item (a) above.

                    e.  Anne (b. ca. 1 575) - Md ., ca. 1 593  a Mr. Harwood of London.

                    f.  Sarah (b. ca. 1576) - Md., ca. 1594, John (Joshua) Randall, Clerke (sic), 
                      of London.

                    g.  Henry (b. ca. 1578) - "Third Sonne". - (See 3 below. )
6
3.  HENRY (b. ca. 1578; d. 1625) - "Third Sonne".  It is believed that he became a merchant of London trading with the Virginia Colony; that he md., ca. 1601, Elizabeth Pickernell? (b. ca. 1582); and that he died in 1625, being survived by his widow and ason John (see 4. below) and other probable children.  The minutes of the Council and General Court of the Colony of Virginia, on page 73, show the following Court Order.

"At a Court held Oct. 14, 1625, beinge p'sent sr. Francis Wyatt, Knight, Governor, etc., Capt. Francis West, Capt. Roger Smith, Capt. Ralph Hamer, Cpt. Samuel Mathews,  Mr. William Clayborne.  It is ordered y  the p'vost Marshall  shall receave all such debts and tobacco as shall be dew Elizabeth ffox, widow, and to take the charge of sendinge of the same to her unto England and receave biil of ladinge for  ye same, and to pay such debts as ffox did owe in this country."

4.  JOHN (b. ca. 1602) - "Sonne and heire of Henry" - (See 3 above).  The following is believed of him.

(1)  He and one John Pickernell (probably a close relative) were associated with his father in the trading business, and they continued that business after the father's death.  During 1625, while that vessel was at port in England, they delivered goods to the purser of the "Elizabeth" for transport to Virginia; and while Pickernell accompanied the shipment as agent (and died aboard the "Elizabeth") Fox remained in England.  After the vessel arrived in Virginia a court was held on 28 November 1625, and the Provost Marshal was ordered to "give a discharge to the purser of the Elizabeth for the receipte of those goodes w'ch he hath receaved of John ffox and John Pickernell who died at sea, and to take the Charge of sendinge of the tobacco made of those goodes into England." - Minutes of the Council and General Court of the Colony of Virginia.)  The purser of the "Elizabeth" was the ship's officer who kept the account, and had custody, of the goods which Fox and Pickernell had delivered to him.  By order of the court the purser delivered the goods to the Provost Marshal to be exchanged for tobacco which the latter sent to Fox in England.  The court minutes, at a later date, contain two other separate references (on pages 72 and 79) to John Pickernell's death.  Dr. J. Ben Robinson, a student of Fox family history, has stated a belief that punctuation marks used in the pertinent sentence contained in the court minutes indicate that John Fox also died at sea. Since no record has been found to definitely show that he died in 1625 (as was shown for John Pickernell), and in view of the following listed items, it is evident that he did not die at that time but succeeded his father as a merchant-trader with \lirginia. The presence or absence of unctuation marks in the said pertinent sentence obviously is a weak basis for the belief of Dr. Robinson. The manner of constructing and punctuating sentences in 1625 wasdifferent from that of today; and, besides this, many public officialsthroughout the passing years have been notorious for poor construction and punctuation of sentences.

In the Rare Book Room of the Congressional Library at Washington, D.C., there is a publication (Catalog Number: - F229.V85.1620a) entitled "Virginia Company of London", which contains "A note of the Shipping, Men, and Provisions, Sent and Provided for Virginia, by the Right Honorable, the Earl of Southampton, and the Company, the yeare 1620."  In this note it is shown that - "The Elizabeth, of 40 Tunnes, was sent in August 1620 with 20 persons".  This vessel doubtless was the same "Elizabeth" mentioned in 1625, as noted above.  It is not certain that the "Elizabeth" ever was owned and operated by the Foxes.

(2)  He married about 1625, his wife evidently being Elizabeth Convers (sister of John Convers subsequently mentioned herein), and became the father of the children named in item (9) below.

(3)  He was the John Fox, Sr., who on 7 March 1639 witnessed the will (probated 26 March 1640-of Alexander Comber (alias Conver), citizen and wood-monger of London, who gave bequests of 20 shillings to each of his cousins Isabell Fox and John Fox (Jr.). - (C. A. Converse - Converse Family, page 882.)

 (4)  He was the John Fox, "merchant trading to Virginia" and Commander of the "Whitehorse and Currycombe", who complied with the Order of the Committee of the Admiralty, dated 8 August 1650, that "merchants trading to Virginia" go in companies to secure their ships against the enemies of the Commonwealth, this being during the rule of Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector. - (Va. Mag. of H. & B., Vol. 17, 1909, page 142.)

(5)  He was the Captain John Fox, Commander of the "Thomas and Anne", who is named in the will (dated 2 Nov. 1653j probated 1 May 1654) of John Convers as his loving friend, and overseer and lawful attorney "to receive all my debts in Virginia and to dispose of this my cargo of goods in the ship called the Thomas and Anne, - - - and to choose another attorney, or more, to help him to manage this business - - -".  In pursuance of the authority to choose another attorney, as shown by Deed Book II, pages 98-99, for Essex County, Va., Francis Cantor (Carter?) was lawful attorney for Captain John Fox, Commander of the "Thomas and Anne".
     John Convers also bequeathed to Captain John Fox £5 (for the purchase of a ring) and other items, and he bequeathed to Mrs. Elizabeth Fox 20 shillings (for the purchase of a ring).  John Convers apparently was the father of Alexander Comber (alias Conver) mentioned in item (3) above. - (C. A. Converse - Converse Family, page 60-1; Sherwood - American Colonists in English Records, 2nd Series, page 149; Waters - Genealogical Gleanings in England, II, page 1030-1.)

 (6)  He was the John Fox who is mentioned as Commander of the "Thomas and Anne" during 1655-1656. - (W. & M. Qtrly., Vol. 20, page 187. and Vol. 21, page 259.)  One Henry Cox (a London merchant) arrived in London in May 1655, having come from Virginia in the "Thomas and Ann" commanded bv John Fox.  His business was "to make sale of the Tobacco he
8
brought over with him, and likewise to fitt himself for a return as he shall see cause".  Some late writers of articles on the Fox family have erroneously identified this Henry Cox as Henry Fox (b. ca. 1650) and wondered - "Did he travel with his father?"  It is obvious that the answer is "no" as relates to the foregoing.

(7)  He was the John Fox, Marriner (sic),of Stepney Parish in County Middlesex, England, who in 1659 "sent greetings" and ordered that all debts due him in Virginia be collected, and appointed Mr. Jonathan Newell to "receave" and recover the same.  The order, dated April 1, 1659, evidently was written in England incident to the retirement of Captain Fox as a "marriner" and was brought to Virginia by his son John Fox, Jr., as mentioned in item 5. (2) below. - (York County, Va., Record Book, 1657 1663, page 148; Ellen M. Cocke - Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia, page    .)

(8)  He was the John Fox of Wapping Wall (in Stepney Parish), County Middlesex, England, whose nuncupative will was probated in 1665. - (Canterbury Wills, 1661 1670.)

 (9)  Though the forementioned pedigree chart of the family of "Fox, of Great Missenden" recites nothing of him except that he was "sonne and heire of Henry", he married Elizabeth Convers, as mentioned in item (2) above, and had issue:

a.  John (b. ca. 1626) - (See 5 below.)

b.  Isabell (b. ca. 1628) - Named as "my cousin" in the Will of Alexander Comber (alias Conver), as mentioned in item (3) above.  She probably died young.

c.  Stephen (b. ca. 1630) - Records show that he was a member of a merchant family of London trading with the English Colonies in America.  In 1662 he was aboard the "Restauracion" when that vessel encountered two storms at sea and suffered  much damage and loss.  It is evident that he then was in command of the vessel, but it is not so stated.  In 1663 he died aboard the "Fortune" (as stated in the proving of his will), which evidently was another vessel being operated in the family trading business.  He apparently was unmarried.  The following letter written by him in the year preceding his death was proved in London as his will. - (Canterbury Wills, 1661-1670, Folio 119.)

 "Stephen Fox Att Sea.  Latitude 24 Degrees. 7br ye 9th 1662. Aboard yeRestauracion.  Lovinge Brother.  These certifie you we sett sayle from New England the 5th August, encountered two storms, lost our mastes, thrown overboard fish and mickrell and pipestaves & 3 horses drowned, one of which was betwixt your selfe and my brother Thomas soe that you have lost all,  as well as my Brother Thomas and myselfe and Peter.  I know not whether I have saved any thing or noe till I come to some Port and I hope you paid the £3.3s. I charged to you
9
from Deale.  I have sent 50 or 60 or 70 cwt of Tobacco in one Captain Thomas Carter's hands at Nancemund in Jeames River.  I had a servant run away in Virginia, thatmakes mee not knowe what Quantitie of Tobacco is in Captain Carter's hands.  Lett my Brother Peter, my sister Mary, and my Brother William have it. Captain Jno. Whitty, who uses Virginia, knowes the man, and will bring it home, which will be £ 70 or £ 80 apiece, and £ 70 or £ 80 amongst you all for mourninge.  I am in hast the shipp being under saile.  Your loveing Brother Stephen Fox."

Administration 20 October 1663, to Brother John Fox.
  (See W. & M. Col . Qtrly., Vol . XX, pp. 262-266. )

Note:  Deale, as mentioned in the above letter, was and now is a seaport and watering place of County Kent, England.  Boat-building and sail-making are carried on.  The well-known Downs afford excellent anchorage.

                d.  Thomas (b. ca. 1632) - Mentioned as a brother of Stephen Fox, i n 1662 .

                e.  Peter (b. ca. 1634) - Mentioned as a brother of Stephen Fox, i n 1662 .

                f.  Mary (b. ca. 1636) - Mentioned as a sister of Stephen Fox, i n 1662 .

               g.  William (b. ca. 1638) - Mentioned as a brother of Stephen Fox, i n 1662 .


     	5.  JOHN (b. ca. 1626; d. in 1682/3) - He was the son of the John Fox, Sr., and the cousin of Alexander Comber (alias Conver), as mentionea in item 4. (3) above; and he was the brother of Stephen Fox, as mentioned in item 4. (9)c. above.  The following is believed of him:

     (1)  He was associated with other members of his family in merchant-trader operations, as is evidenced by the letter mentioned in item
   4. (9)c. above.

         (2) He was the Captain John Fox who was Commander of the "William and John".  Early in the month of April 1659 he sailed from England to Virginia, taking with him the order written by his father, as mentioned in item 4.(7) above, and the following described order issued by the High Court of Admiralty in England. - (Tyler's Qtrly. H. & G. Mag., Vol. 5, page 257; Records of York County, Va.)

           "In ye difference between Mr. William Lee pltr & Capt. John Price Comandr of the Honorr.  Itt is he opinion of this Court & accordingly ordered that ye deftupon his request have an Appeal to ye High Court of Admiralty in

1 0
England and that Capt. Holman, Capt. ffox, Mr. Clem Harris & Mr. William Calow view ye tobaccoe in difference & beng sworne before Col- George Reade Esq. make report under y-hands attested by Col. Reade to ye said Court of Admiralty for ye more speedy bringing to an issue & period ye said difference. April the 4th 1659."

(3)  Early in the month of June 1659 the "William and John" sailed from Virginia on a return voyage to England, with Captain John Fox as Commander of the vessel.  A letter written by Richard Longman, Merchant of London, to Richard Jones, living in "Cheescake parish Yorke River" in Virginia, the letter being relative to a shipment of tobacco, recites the following.

"--- the William and John, Captain ffox, is not arrived as yet but expected very speedily, - - - your assured friend, the 15th of June 1659." - (Tyler's Qtrly., H. & G. Mag., Vol. 1, 1919-20, page 272; W. & M. Col. Qtrl., Vol. 26, 1917-18, page 29.)

(4)  Early in 1660 Charles II was proclaimed king of England and Scotland.  He sailed from the Hague and was met at Dover by General Monk who conducted him to London.  Upon his arrival in London, on 29 May 1660, Charles took the throne; however, his coronation did not occur until 23 April 1661.  Historians show the period of his reign as 1660-1685.  The restoration of Charles to the throne was celebrated in Virginia, on proclamation of the governor (Sir William Berkeley), on 20 October 1660.  The "William and John" was in port during the celebration and Captain John Fox, Commander, participated in the occasion.  The York County Levy, October 1660, included a sum to pay Captain Fox for 6 cases of drams and for firing "his great gunnes". - (Tyler's Qtrly., H. & G. Mag., Vol. 1, 1919-20, page 247; W. & M. Col. Qtrly., Vol. 1, 1892-3, page 176.)

(5)  He was the Captain John Fox, Mariner, who on 2 April 1661 married Margaret Thomas in St. Dunstan's Church, Stepney Parish, County Middlesex, England.  This evidently was his second marriage.

(6)  He was the John Fox to whom, together with Thomas Lester and Gilbert Thornbrough, King Charles II himself, in the second year of his reign, gave a grant of land in Virginia.  This grant is mentioned in notes made by the late Conway Robinson, Esqr., from a record book of the General Court of Colonial Virginia, which book was destroyed during the War Between the States.  The title of the book was given as "Judgments and Orders, 1664-1670"; and the note taken from page 556 thereof reads - "Grant of 20th September in 2d of Charles by the King himself to Thos. Lester, John Fox, and Gilbert Thornbrough, dated at Johnstone" -- (Johnstone is in Renfrewshire, Scotland).  Mr.Robinson gave the year of the grant as "1650 (Minutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia, page 503)". - Tyler's Qtrly. Mag. of H. & B., Vol. 21, 1939-40, page    .)  Mr. Robinson's data was published in Volume 8 of the Virginia Magazine of History and
11
Biography, under the caption "Notes from the Council and General Court Records, 1641-1659", and mention of the grant to Thos. Lester, etc., is shown on page 73 of the said Volume 8.  Since the second year of Charles I fell in 1626 and he was beheaded on 30 January 1649 it is evident that he was not the king who gave the grant to John Fox et al.

     The second year of the reign of Charles II extended from 29 May 1661 to 29 May 1662; therefore, the controlling factor being "20th September in 2- of Charles", it is evident that the abovementioned grant was made on 20 September 1661.  Prior to 1660 Charles II had no status which legally entitled him to make a grant of land in the English Colony of Virginia.  The dates of "1650" and "1641-1659", as mentioned in the next preceding paragraph, do not apply in this connection; and it is apparent that --either Mr. Robinson's notes do not show the correct date applicable to the grant, -- or his notes became jumbled in the process of arranging and printing them at a later date.  The portion of land which fell to ohn Fox under this grant doubtless was a lOOO-acre tract which adjoined lands granted to John Lewis in 1667 and which in 1750 was divided between the Reverend John Fox and his brother William Fox.  At the time of division the said tract was described as being situated in Petworth Parish of Gloucester County, Va.  The lands of John Lewis lay partly in Gloucester County and partly in New Kent County. - (E. M. Cocke - "Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia", page 23.)

     One can only speculate as to why Charles II personally gave a grant of land to John Fox and his associates.  However, it properly can be assumed that the grant was given to them in appreciation of important services which they previously had rendered in the king's behalf, either before or after his restoration to the throne.

(7)  He, as Captain John Fox, Mariner, doubtless was still Commander of the "William and John" at the time of his marriage to Margaret Thomas on 2 April 1661.  From item 4. (9) c. above it is evident that he soon thereafter relinquished his sea-farinq duties connected with the family merchant-trader operations to his brother Stephen Fox and devoted his own time to business affairs in London and/or its environs.  The last known record of him in London shows that on 20 October 1663 he was granted administration of the estate of his said brother. - (Continued in Part III, Chapter 1.)

CHARLES II

(KING OF ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, AND IRELAND)


          On 30 January -1649 Charles I (King of England, Scotland, and Ireland) was executed, and immediately thereafter England was declared to be a commonwealth.  The office of king and the House of Lords were abolished.  Power was vested in the Army of Independents (under Oliver Cromwell) as the controlling power, the Long Parliament as the formal legislative authority, and a Council of State as the formal executive.  On 16 December 1653 an Instrument of Government for England, Scotland, and Ireland, and their dominions, was adopted (by Cromwell and his Council of Officers) as a written constitution, and under it Cromwell assumed the office of Lord Protector.  When the Parliament (for which the Instrument provided) met in September 1654 it passed a constitution of which the Instrument was the basis. - (Webster's New International Dictionary - A Reference History Of The World, p. 51; Harvard Classics - The Five Foot Shef Of Books, Vol. 43, p. 113.) - The Commonwealth Government existed from the abolition of the monarchy in 1649 until the restoration in 1660. - (See ''Commonwealth'l as described in The New Century Dictionary and in The American International Encyclopedia, and "Commonwealth Of England" as described in The Peader's Digest Great Encyclopedic Dictionary.)

          At the time of the execution of Charles I his eldest son, Charles the Prince of Wales, was a refugee at The Hague, in Holland.  Upon receiving news of the execution the prince immediately claimed the royal title. On 5 February 1649 the Scottish Parliament, meeting at Edinburgh,recognized his claim.  Following this recognition certain commissioners were sent over from Scotland to inform the prince that the governing body of Scotland would espouse his cause "if he should take the Covenant with its testimonies, and engage to do his utmost to enforce the whole covenanting system over England and Ireland".  This the prince agreed to do, and he was invited over to Scotland.  He arrived in that country, entering through a port at the mouth of the Spey River, on 3 July 1650; and there he signed the Covenant before landing from the vessel in which he had been transported.  From thence he marched southwards by Aberdeen, Dundee, and Saint Andrews, to Falkland Palace in County Fife; and there, on 15 July 1650, he was pro- claimed king under the title of Charles II.

          The Council of State at Whitehall in London, England, became alarmed at the progress being made by Charles II and sent an independent army, commanded by Oliver Cromwell, to stop it.  This army met Charles' royalist forces, commanded by General David Leslie, in battle at Dunbar, in Haddingtonshire, where on 3 September 1650 the royalists were totally defeated and Charles fled to England and found refuge among the royalist sympathizers there.

                                                                      13
         Towards the end of 1650 Charles II returned to Scotland, and on 1 January 1651 he received the crown at Scone, in Perthshire.  Having collected an army of English and Scotch supporters, in July 1651 he led a royalist force into England and was pursued by Cromwell with an army of independents.  On 3 September 1651 Charles was overtaken at Worcester, in orcestershire, where the royalists were utterly scattered in a defeat which completely crushed the royal party in England.  Charles narrowly escaped being taken prisoner at this battle and was compelled to become a fugitive.  After wandering about the country in disguise during a period of forty-five days he reached the coast of the English Channel and escaped to Normandy,in France.

         Prior to 1660 Charles II went from France to Holland.  His residence for a period of time was in the city of Breda, and it was there that on 14 April 1660 he signed the "Declaration of ereda" in which he promised liberty of conscience, a general amnesty, etc., on his restoration to the throne of England, Scotland, and Ireland.  This declaration contained in a letter from Charles to General George Monk (commander of the English, or independent, army in Scotland) was introduced by the latter to a new parliament assembled in London, and on 1 May 1660 it was accepted by that parlia- ment.  On 8 May 1660 Charles II was proclaimed King of England, Scotland, and Ireland.  He sailed from The Hague, in Holland, to the English port of Dover, in County Kent, and was met there by General Monk who escorted him into London on 29 May 1660 amidst universal acclamations.  His coronation took place on 23 April 1661.

         The abovementioned General Monk served with Oliver Cromwell in Scotland.  In 1650 Monk reduced that country to obedience within a few weeks. Throughout the succeeding nine years (ending with the restoration) Scotland was governed by commissioners, who sent a certain number of their members to the English Parliament in London; and during that period of time, except for a short absence in 1653 to assist in two naval defeats of the Dutch, General Monk remained in Scotland at the head of an English army to secure possession of that country to the Commonwealth.  The return of Charles II was arranged with General Monk, as heretofore said, and the king rewarded his restorer with many favors, including the title "Duke of Albemarle"  and, to others with him, a grant of the lands of Carolina in North America.

         Though Charles II was proclaimed and crowned King of Scotland he did not reign as such in that country until after the Commonwealth ceased to exist.  History records his residence in Scotland during the years between his father's execution and the restoration as being only two short periods of time, - from 15 July 1650 to 3 September 1650 and from on or about 1 January 1651 to on or about some date in July 1651.  His political and/or military activities in Scotland and in England prior to 8 May 1660 evidently were considered to be those of an intruder and enemy of the Commonwealth under which the office of king had been abolished.  Thus, under laws governing the Commonwealth, prior to 8 May 1660 Charles II had no legal authority to perform any function which pertained to the office of king.  One of the functions which pertained to that office was the granting of lands in the English Colonies of North America.

                                                          1 4
           The recognized reign of Charles II, as recorded by historians, extended from 8 May 1660 (date of proclamation as King of England, Scotland, and Ireland) until his death in February 1685. During the early years after the restoration he was described as being such a very merry and easy-going king that whenever his favorites asked him for land in America he readily granted it.  In fact, he was so freehanded that sometimes he even gave away what really did not belong to him.  Some exceedingly large grants made by him were the following named ones.

           In l663 Carolina was granted to Lord Clarendon, the Duke of Albemarle,  and others.

           In 1664 all the country claimed by the Dutch - (the later colonies of New York, New Jersey, and Delaware) - was granted tohis brother James, Duke of York.

          In 1667 Carolina was extended to include the whole southern section of the present United States of America ana was granted in its entirety to Lord Shaftsbury.

             During the second year of his reign Charles II granted land in Virginia to three of his subjects (presumed to be among his favorites).  A paragraphincluded in George H. S. King's memorial to Henry Fox of King William County, Va., as published in Volume 21 (1939-40) of Tyler's Quarterly Magazine, reads as follows:

       "The late Conway Robinson, Esquire, made some notes from a book of 'Judgments and Orders 1664 - 1670', one of the record books of the General Court of Virginia which were destroyed during the War Between the States.  From page 556 of this book he notes a 'Grant of 20th of September in the 2d of Charles by the King himself to Thos. Lester, John Fox, and Gilbert Thornbrough, dated at Johnstone'.  Mr. Robinson gives the date of this grant as 1650 (Minutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia, page 503.)."

       As is elsewhere stated by this writer, the year "1650" shown in the abovementioned note of Mr. Robinson is a mistake made either by himself or by someone else in the process of arranging and printing the notes at a later date.  It is evident that the grant was made on 20 September 1661, in the second year of Charles II; and the John Fox named in the grant doubtless was the John Fox (father of Henry Fox of King William County, Va.) who arrived in Virginia in 1664 and claimed his property before the General Court of that colony.

              Prior to learning all of the herein stated facts concerning the activities and status of Charles II during the period of 1649 - 1660, and in view of the year "1650" mentioned in the evidently tangled notes of Mr. Conway Robinson, this writer entertained the erroneous belief that the John Fox to whom the grant of land was given by the king was that one who is described in the following account.

                                                                     15
 		With Charles II in France was one John Fox (b. 1614, at Farley, in Wiltshire, England), son of William and Elizabeth Fox and brother of Sir Stephen Fox, who also had been in the service of Charles I.  Upon the restoration, in 1660, he returned to England with Charles II and was made Clerk of the Acatry.  His male line became extinct in 1699.

NOTE:


                          For a proper appraisal of the lineage shown in the several chapters included in Part III of this sketch, all readers should keep in mind the fact that data compiled on the Virginia descendants of Fox  of Great Missenden and published prior to 1950 was based on the few  fragmentary public and private records then known to the compilers of such data.  In some instances those records were interpreted, either broadly or narrowly, to conform with a theory of the compiler; and the conclusions arrived at are contrary to evidence presented in other records found at a later date.  This sketch is based on an exhaustive study of all presently known records, and the writer is confident that the lineage shown herein conforms with evidence presented in the said records.  The foregoing will explain why the genealogical positions of certain persons named herein are different from those shown in data compiled and published prior to 1950.  Reference made herein to publications containing data on the Fox family indicates that this writer agrees with only such portions of that data which is in con formity with this sketch.

CHAPTER 1



JOHN FOX (b. ca. 1626; d. in 1682-3) - (Continued from Part II)


          It is conjectured that at the time of his brother Stephen's death the family business in England had become seriously impaired, if not in the process of becoming defunct, as a result of the loss of goods at sea and perhaps elsewhere; and such business reverses prompted John Fox to emigrate to Virginia shortly after the administration of Stephen's estate.  The name "John ffox; destination, Virginia", appears on page 510 of a record entitled "Servants To Foreign Plantations, 1654-1663", as published in the book "Bristol and America - A Record Of The First Settlers In The Colonies Of North America, 1654-1685 - (see page 96)". The said page 510 is one of a total of 545 pages covering the list of emigrants registered for passage during the 9-year period of 1654-1663, which suggests that John Fox doubtless was registered for passage at some time during the middle towards the end of 1663, and that the vessel on which he sailed probably did not leave port at Bristol until the early part of 1664. Regular navigation across the Atlantic Ocean from England to the orth American Colonies was first established, and then was in continuance, at Bristol; therefore, the presence of John Fox at that port thus can be accounted for.  He evidently went there from London or its environs.  The author of the forementioned book states that though these "Servants of the Plantations" were officially known as such, this name was a misnomer in the vast majority of cases.  The "vast majority" went out as free emigrants paing the cost of their own transportation and the cost of transportation of others who went with them as their "headrights".  It is assumed that this John Fox paid the cost of his own transportation, since no subsequent record of him as a "headright" has been found.  He doubtless settled on the lands [See Part II, Item 5. (6)] which had been granted to hiln on 20 September 1661.

              At some time between 25 July 1681 and 28 February 1682-3 John Fox bought of Thomas Hanckes 200 acres of land lying partly in New Kent County and partly in Gloucester County, Va., adjoining lands of William Anderson, Coll John Lewis, and William Lynes.  The said 230 acres were part of a grant by patent dated 7 April 1674 to Charles Hawley and J--- Garrett, which had escheated to the crown on 25 July 1681 and subsequently became the property of Thomas Hanckes.  This land was confirmed by grant to John Fox on 28 February 1682-3. After the death of John Fox it was re-granted, by Thomas Lord Culpepper with consent of the Council, to Henry Fox 1st on 16 April 1682-3. - (Land Patent 13ook VII, pages 245, 326, and 327; Mason's "Records of Colonial Gloucester County, Va.", Vol. 1, page 31; Ellen M. Cocke's "Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia", pages 11 and 12). This land evidently was near the land which was granted to John Fox on 20 September 1661, as mentioned in Part II, Item 5. (6); and both of these tracts evidently adjoined the lands granted to John Lewis in 1667.
18

            The wives and older children of John Fox doubtless were born in England, and the first wife (name not known) died there; but no record has yet been found as to when his second wife and the older children arrived in Virginia.  It is probable that their arrival was in 1664/5 and that the birth of the herein last named daughter occurred shortly thereafter.  The few extant records of early Gloucester and New Kent Counties, together with family traditions, indicate that the following named children lived with him in Virginia.

           a.  HENRY 1st (b. ca. 1650) - (See Chapter 2)

         b.  JOHN  (b. ca. 1652) - He evidently was the John Fox who, according to tradition, married a Miss Lightfoot.  Some writers suppose that she was Frances Lightfoot (daughter of Francis Light foot of London, England) whose brother Charles Lightfoot died in England in 1696 leaving in his will a bequest of fifty pounds to his sister Frances in Virginia "if she ever comes into England and claims it or not else". - (Letter of Dr. J. Ben Robinson, 8 Sept. 1954. ) Since the Register of Saint Peters Parish, New Kent Cosunty, 1687-1786", on page 435, contains an entry showing that "Fran Lightfoot Died ffebry-: l9th 1725-6" this writer believes that the deceased was the said sister of the forementioned Charles Lightfoot and that she died unmarried.  John Fox evidently married a sister of Thomas Lytfoot/Lightfoot of Baltimore County, Md., whose will (dated 23 Mar. 1686-7; probated 17 June 1687) was witnessed  by John Fox. - (Md. Cal. of Wills, Vol. 2, page 19.)  John's wife probably was the Margaret Fox (evidently a widow) whose name appears on the Quit Rent Roll of King and Queen County, Va., for 1704 as the owner of 100 acres of land.  It appears that she, her sister Frances, and her brother Thomas came from England to Virginia with relatives, - John and Philip Lightfoot; and that after her marriage (ca 1675) to John Fox he and Thomas Lightfoot moved to Maryland prior to 23 March 1686-7. John Fox perhaps died in Maryland, after which his widow and some of their children moved to Virginia.

         Some writers state that John the brother of Henry Fox was the father of sons who lived in Virginia, but to this writer it is apparent that of those who only are supposed to be his sons the Reverend John and William were the sons of Henry Fox 2nd (b. ca. 1674) and George was the grandson of John the brother of Henry.  John probably was the father of the followin named persons who also lived in Virginia.

    (a )  SAMUEL FOX (b. ca . 1676) - was a grand juror for King and Queen County in 1704. - (Fleet - Va. Col. Absts., Vol. 7, p. 40.) This writer believes that he married Mary ---, about 1 699, and that among hi s children were :




19
1.  JOHN (baptized on 18 May 1700, as per the register of Abingdon Parish, Gloucester County, Va., and probably was that John Fox who made his will in Middlesex County, Va., in 1769, leaving his estate to his wife Tabitha and daughter Margaret.)

2.  Mary (b. Cd. 1711; unmarried; was susceptor/godmother for her niece Rebecca Fox who, on 23 February 1752, was baptized in the church at Orangeburgh, S.C.)

3. SAMUEL (b. ca. 1715 and d. ca. 1753; married Willoughby --- and moved to South Carolina where, during the period of 1743-1756, he and/or his family lived consecutively in Prince Frederick Parish, Winyah, and in Orangeburg Township, as mentioned in the Register Book of Prince Frederick Parish, Winyah, S.C., and in A. S. Salley's History of Orangeburg County, S.C.)


(b)  JOHN FOX (b. ca. 1678) - Signed the inventory of James Thewell's estate, in Essex County, Va., as presented on 14 May 1713 . - ( Fl eet - Va . Col . Absts ., Vol . 8, p . 47 . )  He was on the Quit Rent Roll for Essex County in 1715 for 100 acres of land.  This writer believes that he was the father of the

1.  GEORGE FOX (b. ca. 1702) who married Mary --- and lived in Caroline County, Va., and who (as mentioned in the W. & M. Col . Qtrly., Vol . XXVI, pp. 129 et seq. ) was the father of:

(1)  GABRIEL (of Hampshire County, W. Va.)

(2) AMOS (of Fairfax County, Va . )

and probably,
(3) JAMES (married Mary Bartleson in Philadelphia, Pa., and had sons Bartleson Fox and William Fox who settled in Loudown County, Va.)


NOTE


	The forementioned Dr. J. Ben Robinson has proposed and advanced the theory that John Fox (b. ca. 1652), the brother of Henry Fox (b. ca.1650), was the Lieutenant John Fox mentioned in the records of King and Queen County and the later Captain John Fox mentioned in the records of King William County; and that this Lieutenant and later Captain John Fox was a different person than John Fox "late Merchant of London" (b. ca.1676 ) who wa s a documented son of Henry Fox ( b . ca . 1650 ) . - See the Note included in Chapter 2, Section I, for this writer's comment on Dr. Robinson's theory.

CHAPTER 2 - SECTION 1

HENRY FOX, 1st

	At about 1673 Henry Fox (b. ca. 165Q, d. 1714) married Anne West (See Chapter 2, Section 2, Number 12), daughter of Colonel John West of York County, Va. - (Henning - Statutes of Virginia, Vol. VI, pages 321-324 and 428.)  The following is known of him, as found in the indicated references.

	(1)  On 16 April 1682-3, Henry Fox, "Son and heire of Mr. John Fox, dec'd.", obtained a grant for 300 acres of land lying partly in New Kent County and partly in Gloucester County.  This grant included the 200 acres described in Part III, Chapter 1 (2nd paragraph), and an additional 100 acres due Henry Fox for two headrights (Robert Seale and Thomas Lee) imported into the colony by him. - Land Patent Book VII, page 245.)  The additional lOO-acre tract pehaps was on the New Kent (now King and Queen) side of Poropotank Swamp.  Under the law of primogeniture then in force in Virginia he doubtless also inherited the lOOO-acre tract of land mentioned in Part II, item 5.(6), second paragraph.  It properly might be assumed that Henry Fox lived in Gloucester County until a short while before 1695 and then moved to Pamunkey Neck (Saint John's Parish) in King and Queen (now King William) County where he acquired the following mentioned lands.

	  a.  Prior to 6 June 1699 Henry Fox acquired land in Pamunkey Neck.  The exact time of acquisition, the exact location, and the number of acres acquired have not been determined by this writer; but the fact of ownership is stated in a grant made to him on the said date, as mentioned in the next succeeding item.

	  b.  On 6 June 1699 Henry Fox was granted 330 acres of marsh land in King and Queen County, Pamunkey Neck, adjoining his own land and that of others.  Due for transporting 7 persons. - (Land Patent Book IX, page 203.)

	  c.  On 24 April 1700 Henry Fox was granted, by patent, 1982 acres of land (in three separate tracts) in Pamunkey Neck.  Notation of this grant is contained in the records of Colonial Office #5, Vol. 1310, pages 272-273, - as part of the collections in the Public Records Office in London, England, transcripts of which are in the Congressional Library at Washington, D. C.  The notation shows that the land was surveyed for "Henry ox, Gentlernan".  Part of the said land evidently was a 821-acre tract situated on Cohoke Creek in Pamunkey Neck. - (Land Patent Book IX, page 2Sl.)  On 13 August 1701 the formation of King William County was authorized, but  earlier in that year a committee had been appointed to survey all lands in Pamunkey Neck.  The returns of the committee on 4 September 1701 showed that three tracts (containing, respectively, 584 acres, 80 acres, and 521 acres) then had been surveved for Henrv Fox.  The survev evidently was ordered in
22
anticipation of the formation of King William County. -(Journal of House of Burgesses, Vol. 1695-1702, page 282.)

   d.  In 1702, a deed for land in King William County was given to Henry Fox by Thomas Baker and Mary his wife. - (Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog., Vol. 31, 1923, page 343.)

   e.  On 20 June 1707, a deed for Lot 24 in "Delaware town", in King William County, was given to Henry Fox. - (Wm. & Mary Col. Qtrly., Vol. XIV, 1934, 2nd S., page 346.)

    f.  On 31 October 1712, a patent was granted to Henry Fox for 1000 acres of land in King William County as his share of 4000 acres devised by the will of John West (d. 1691) to his heirs. - (Executive Journals, Council of Colonial Virginia,  Vol. III, pages 326 and 327.)

	(2)  The dispositionsofland, made by Henry Fox, so far as has been determined from available records, were the following.  There probably were other dispositions.

   a.  In 1702 (evidently prior to 20 January 1702 -See Item b.),Henry Fox, Gentleman, deeded land in King William County to Richard Littlepage,Gentleman, of New Kent County. (Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog.,Vol.31,1923, page 343.)

   b.  On 20 January 1702 Henry Fox and Richard Littlepage of King William County, Gentlemen, gave to the county of King William two 2 acres of land "on part of which the Court House now stands". - (King William County Court Records, Vol. 1, pages 71-73.)

In the year 1952 the Society of Descendants of Henry Fox and Anne West installed a table  in the courtroom of the King William County courthouse, which table bears an inscription reading as follows:

"Dedicated to the Memory of Henry Fox, First  Presiding Justice of the Court April 20, 1702, and also a Burgess and Sheriff of King William who with Captain Richard Littlepage jointly deeded on January 20, 1702, to the newly formed County of King William the land on which the first courthouse stood and on which the present courthouse was built about the year 1725."

   c.  On 4 March 1703 Henry Fox, Gentleman, deeded land in King William County to Chillion White. - (Va. Mag. of Hist. & Bioy., Vol. 31, 1923, page 175; King William County Court Records, Vol. 1, Page 93.)

    d.  Prior to 10 November 1713 Henry Fox deeded 200 acres of land to Micajah Perry. - (Executive Journals, Council of Colonial Virginia, Vol. III, page 360.)
23
	(3)  The total number of acres of land which Henry Fox acquired in Pamunkey Neck and the total number of acres which he disposed of prior to and during 1704 have not been determined.  The 1704 Quit Rent Roll for King William County shows that he held 2,000 acres of land in that county which were subject to the payment of quitrent.  In King William County he was seated at "Huntington", an elegant brick mansion on the Mattaponi River.  The brick walls were standing until a few years prior to the publishing of Lewis' "King William County, Va." (page 39); and one of the beautiful octagonal bricks from this old house is preserved in the collection of old bricks gathered by the late Arthur P. Gray of West Point, Va.  Prior to 1939 Mr. George H. 5. King (genealogist) of Fredericksburg, Va., visited the site of the "Huntington" house and the adjoining plantation called "Fox's".  At the former place the tenant pointed out to him the old Fox graveyard, although no tomhstones then were evident. - (Tyler's Qtrly. Mag., Vol. 21,1939-1940, page     ).

	(4) Henry Fox was a participant in the CiYiC , political, and religious life of his day.  The following mention is found of him in this connection.

   a .  On 24 October 1691 Henry Fox was a juror in court held at James City. - (Executive Journals, Council of Colonial Virginia, Vol . I, page 204. )

   b.  During the period of 1695-1706 Henry Fox was a Vestryman of Saint John's Parish, King and Queen County (King William County in 1702). - (Wm. & Mary Col. Qtrly., Vol. XX, pages 262-6; Cyclopedia of Va. Biog., Vol. 1, page 239; Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog., Vol. 8, page   ; Tyler's Qtrly. Mag.,  Vol. 21, 1939-1940, pages      ; Executive Journals, Council of Colonial Virginia,  Vol . I I I, pages 66 and 75 . )

   c .  During the peri od of 1 698-1 702 Henry Fox served, by appointment, as a Justice of the Peace (Magistrate) for King and Queen County, and in 1699 he was Presiding Judge of the Court in that County.  On 12 March 1701-2 he was appointed Justice of the Peace for King William County, being the Senior Presiding Justice. -(Executive Journals, Council of Colonial Virginia, Vol. I, page 411;Ibid., Vol. II, page 225; Tyler's Qtrly. Mag., Vol.21, 1939-1940, page    ; Cyclopedia of Va. Biog., Vol. 1, page 239; Fleet - Va. Colonial Absts., Vol. 6, pages 13 and 18; Wm. & Mary Col. Qtrly., Vol . XX, page    ; Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog., Vol . 8, page    . )

   d.  On 17 February 1702 Henry Fox was commissioned as the first Sheriff of King William County, but apparently did not then serve in that office.  In October 1705 he was again commissioned as Sheriff . - (King Wil 1 iam County Record Book No. 2., page 149; Journal of House of Burgesses, Vol. 1702-1712, page 137.)
24
 e.  During the period of 1710-1714 Henry Fox was a member of the House of Burgesses from King William County.  He died in 1714, and the following report was made at the opening of the third session of the Assembly of 1712-14.

"Saturday November 27, 1714. Mr. William Robinson from the  Committee of Privileges and Elections reported that the said Committee had taken into consideration the return of the Writt for electing a Burgess in King William County in the room of Henry Fox, Gentleman, Deceased, and therein comes to report to the House which he read in his place and then delivered it at the table where being again read, the house agreed to the said report which is as follows:  'Resolved that Mr. Orlander Jones is duly Returned a Burgess to serve in this Assembly for the County of King William in the room of Henry Fox, Gentleman, Deceased." - Journal of House of Burgesses , Vol . 1 702 - 1 71 2 , page ix ; Ibid ., Vol . 1 71 2-1 726 , page vii; Cyclopedia of Va. Biog., Vol. 1, page 239; Malcolm H. Harris - A History of Louisa County, Va., page    ; Wm. and Mary Col. Qtrly., Vol. XX, pages 262-6; Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog ., Vol . 8 , page    ; Tyl er ' s Qtrly. Mag ., Vol . 21, 1939-1940, page   . )

	(5)  The following mention is found of him in connection with other events.

a.  Henry Fox signed the Declaration of the Inhabitants of King and Queen County, issued on 12 March 1702, congratulating King William the Third upon his safe return to England and declaring their fidelity to him. - (Fleet - Va. Colonial Absts., Vol. 6, page 4). The said king died on 8 March 1702 from the effects of a fall from his horse; but, if the issue date of the declaration is correctly stated, news of his death did not reach Virginia until sometime af ter 12 March 1702 .

b.  On 20 March 1703 Henry Fox and John Fox were securities for Jane Johns (widow of Richard Johns) who executed her husband's will in 1703. - (Va. Mag. of Hist.  Biog., Vol . 25, page 179. )

c .  On 8 October 1703 Henry Fox wi tnessed a power of attorney given by Francis Wells to Captain George Braxton to collect debts, etc. - (Fleet - Va. Colonial Absts., Vol. 7, King and Queen County, page 48.) Henry Fox then lived in King William County.

d.  On 16 October 1704 Henry Fox and his three brothers-in-law (John, Thomas, and Nathaniel West) petitioned the Governor of the Council and General Court of Virginia "to recover and establish  title to 4000 acres of land in King and Queen County (now King William County) patented by Colonel John West in 1654 and devised by him to the petitioners".  This petition was rejected by the Governor and the Court. - (Calendar of Va. State Papers, Vol. L, page 85; Fleet - Va. Colonial Absts., Vol . 6, pages 29 and 30. )


25
John West, son of Colonel John West and devisee of his father's will, died about 1710/11 and by his will bequeathed to his brother Nathaniel West and his nephews John and Thomas Fox his presumed part of the disputed 4000 acres of land patented by Colonel John West in 1654. On 31 October 1712 Henry Fox petitioned the Council and General Court of Virginia "in behalf of John and Thomas Fox his sons and of Nathaniel West Devisees of John West deceased".  The said petition set forth the following.

"--- the said John West (Colonel John West) did by deed of Gift and by his Will and Testament give and grant unta John West deceased Thomas and Nathaniel West his sons & the s-Henry Fox a certain tract or Divident of land containing by estimation Four thousand acres lying in King & Queen now King William County, which said land the said John West and the petitioners as claiming under him have peaceably enjoyed ever since the year 1654, about which time the petitioners are in- formed the same was granted by patent to the said first named John West, but the petitioners not finding any patent for the same upon record humbly pray that they may be admitted to enter Rights for their several portions of the said Land and that patents may be granted to them respectively for the same, for the more certain confirmation of their Titles."

In response to the petition of 31 October 1712, on that date leave to survey the land was given and the requested patents were granted. - (Executive Journals, Colonial Council of Va., Vol. III, pages 326 and 327; Cocke - Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia, page 12.)

e.  On 28 May 1706 Henry Fox and John West were attorneys for his son John Fox and three other persons who petitioned the House of Burgesses to ease the laws governing trade with the "Tributary Indians". - (Journal of House of Burgesses, Vol. 1702-1712, pages 205 and 207.)

f.  On 23 December 1707 Henry Fox, John Fox, Robert Beverly, and John Walker, acted as arbitrators, between Samuel Matthews and his wife, on the one part, and Richard Wyatt in right of Mary and Barbara Tunstall . - (Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog., Vol . IX, page 311; Cocke-Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia, Page 20.)

9.  On 26 October 1708 Henry Fox was mentioned as entertaining one of the Pamunkey Indians. -(Executive Journals,Council of Colonial Va.,Vol.III, page 198.)

	(6) As previously stated herein, Henry Fox married the daughter of Colonel John West.  They were the parents of the four following named children. - (Cyclopedia of Va. Biog., Vol. 1, page 239; Harris - A History of Louisa County, Va., page    ; Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog., Vol. I, page 318, & Vol. VIII, page    ; Executive Journals, Council of Colonial Va., Vol. III, pages 326 and 327; Wm. & Mary Col. Qtrly., Vol. XX, page 262-266.) Mr. George H. S. King, genealogist, reports a daughter Amv (married --- White, her first cousin) but cites no authority.
26
a.  Henry 2nd (b. ca. 1674). - (See Chapter 3.)

b.  John (b. ca. 1676). - In 1702 he was a l'Lieutenant" in the King and Queen County Militia, and on 12 March 1701-2 (1702) he signed the Declaration of the Inhabitants of King and Queen County congratulating King William the Third upon his safe return to England and declaring their fidelity to him.  During 1702 Robert Carew (Carey) deeded land in the newly formed King William County to John Fox and John Isbell.  On 17 June 1703 John Fox is recorded as being a ''Captain'l in the King William County Militia.  A 600-acre tract of land was listed on the 1704 Quit Rent Roll for King William County as owned by l'Captain John Foxll.  He ("Captain John Fox") and his brother Thomas Fox owned separate lands which bounded on a tract granted by patent to Thomas West in 1714/5. -(Fleet - Va. Colonial Absts., Vol. 6, page 5, & Vol. 7, page 10; Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog., Vol. 31, 1923, page 343, & Vol. 32, 1924, page 71; Land Patent Book X, page 226; Cocke - Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia, page   .)

On 28 May 1706 John Fox and three other persons petitioned the General Assembly to ease the laws governing trade with the "Tributary Indians". - (Journal of the House of Burgesses, 1702-1712, pages 205 and 207.)  This petition evidently was incident to the launching of his later business career as a "Merchant of London", which venture failed in 1712 and resulted in a period of imprisonment of John Fox for debt and his impoverishment during the remainder of his lifetime.  He died, on 19 January 1767, in Hanover County, Va., as a ward of St. Paul's Parish.  It appears that the lands which he acquired at various times were transferred or sold in order to partially satisfy the claims of his creditors. -(Executive Journals, Council of Colonial Va., Vol. III, page 326, & Vol. IV, pages 44 and 45; Hanover County Court Records, Vol. I, 1733-1735, page 26; Journal of House of Burgesses, 1712-1726, pages 140, 367, and 368; Henning - Statutes of Virginia, Vol. IV, page 141; Cocke - Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia, page 20 et seq.)

John Fox married about 1699.  Dr. J. Ben Robinson, one of his descendants, states that his wife probably was a daughter of Edmund Bacon of New Kent County.  The Vestry Book of St. Paul's Parish, Hanover County, Va., 1706-1786, contains mention of John Fox.

Mention of his children - William Fox, Sarah Fox, Isaac Fox, and Joseph Fox - is found in the Vestry Book of Blisland Parish, New Kent and James City Counties, Va., 1721 1786.  His son Joseph Fox (wife Frances) is mentioned also in the Register of St. Peter's Parish, New Kent County, Va., 1684-1786.  The George Fox (died 12 August 1719) who is mentioned on page 420 of the printed copies of the Vestry Book and Register of St. Peter's Parish, New Kent and James City Counties, 1687-1786, probably was another son.  Family records show the name of a son Thomas who was the ancestor of Dr. J. Ben Robinson, who states that there was yet another son by the name of John.

NOTE

	This writer does not subscribe to the heretofore mentioned theory that Lieutenant/Captain John Fox" was a different person  than "John Fox, late Merchant of London".  Dr. Robinson assumes that during the period of 1700-1712 John the son of Henry Fox was  "immature, without financial responsibility, - without determined qualities of high integrity", and therefore was unfitted to hold military rank or to be entrusted with the responsibilities implied in items (5)b and (5)f of this chapter and section.  Dr. Robinson further assumes that ownership by "Captain John Fox" of the lands adjoining a tract which was granted to Thomas West in 1714/15 proves that the said "Captain John Fox" was the then livinq brother and not the son of Henry Fox. The significant fact of the heretofore mentioned assoCiation between the John Fox and the Thomas Lytfoot (Lightfoot) of Baltimore, Md., bears unfavorably on Dr. Robinson's theory and thus far he has persistently evaded discussing the matter with this writer.

	This writer is unaware of any credible document which in any way indicates that during the period of 1700-1712 John the son of Henry Fox could have been described in a derogatory manner.  The said John doubtless was capable in all respects for doing the things concerning which Dr. Robinson states that he was unfitted for.  In view of the wealth and social and political position of his father, and the ambitious spirit evidenced in his great venture, it is understandable that this John should have responsible military and financial relationships at an early age in life.  He evidently was a young man of optimism and enterprising spirit, being a respected and influential person, and being also a person of considerable means until the financial disaster which led to insolvency in 1715. The 600 acres listed for him on the Quit Rent Rolls for 1704 were acquired by him while he held a commission as "Captain John Fox", and the land was recorded in that name.  In 1714 he then was "John Fox, late of London, Merchant", but the land still remained on the records in the name of "Captain John Fox".

Thomas (b. ca. 1680). - He married, 1707, Mary Tunstall and had issue: - Thomas (b. ca. 1710; d. 1792; md. 1st Philadelphia Claiborne; md. 2nd Philadelphia Herndon) and Joseph (b. ca.___? d. 1788/9; md.

CHAPTER 3 - SECTION 1


HENRY FOX, 2nd

	According fo tradition handed down in the Kendrick family Henry Fox 2nd (b. ca. 1674; d. ca. 1750) married Mary Kendrick (b. ca. 1678).  It is said that she was the sister of John Kendrick (b. ca. 1680) and the daughter of William Kendrick who came from England to Gloucester County, Va., about 1670.  According to James Childs Rives' "Reliques of the Rives", page 310, this Henry Fox married Mary Claiborne (b. ca. 1680) who evidently was the daughter of William and Elizabeth (Ludman) Claiborne. A careful study of data on the Fox, Kendrick, and Claiborne families indicates that Henry Fox 2nd probably married Mary Kendrick about 1697 and that after her death he married Mary Claiborne about 1705.

	The first mention found of Henry Fox 2nd i extant records of Colonial Virginia is during the year 1712.  Earlier mention of him doubtless was contained in the now lost or destroyed records of the Colonial Counties of Gloucester and New Kent.  It is believed that after his marriage to Mary Kendrick he settled in Gloucester County and lived on lands then belonging to his father and which he later inherited from the father's estate.  Such lands could have been the 300 acres, partly in Gloucester and partly in New Kent (later King and Queen) and/or the 1000 acres in Gloucester, as mentioned in Chapter 2, Section 1, item (1), of this sketch.  In 1750 the said 1000 acres of land (in Petworth Parish of Gloucester County) were divided equally between John Fox and William Fox who, as indicated in the two following paragraphs, appear certainly to have been the sons of Henry Fox 2nd and his wife Mary Claiborne.

	In an old book of sermons which once belonged to the Reverend John Fox, on the inside page of the back cover, were several partially erased, penciled notes, one of which is as follows:  "Mrs. Oliver's mother's sister was Mrs. Innis and her mother was Lady Gouche from England". (Gooch so spelled.) - (W. & M. Col. Qtrly., Vol. XXVI, page.)  (Writer's Comment:  Since Ursula Claiborne, sister of Mary Claiborne, the wife of Henry Fox 2nd, married William Gooch this note doubtless refers to a kinship, on his mother's side, between the Reverend John Fox and the Gooch family.)

	An old survey book of Gloucester County shows a survey of a plat in Petworth Parish made in 1750, in which, by a "division", the Revernd John Fox received 500 acres and William Fox 500. - (Stubbs - Descendants of Mordecai Cooke and Thomas Booth, page 234.)  (Writer's Comment:  The said William Fox doubtless was that one who settled in Brunswick County, being named as the son of Henry Fox 2nd and Mary Claiborne.  He married Sarah Avent who was a granddaughter of William Gooch and his wife Ursula Claiborne. - See Joseph Emery Avent's "The Avents and Their Kin  of Avent Ferry, Chatham County, North Carolina" and Ellen M. Cocke's "Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia", page 23.)

29
	

	Prior to or during early 1712 Henry Fox 2nd moved to that part of New Kent County which later became Hanover County, where he acquired land and lived for several years as a resident of St. Paul's Parish.  The following mention of him is contained in the Vestry Book (pages 220, 233, and 256) of St. Paul's Parish, published by C. G. Chamberlayne, of "Ye Lower Church" in New Kent County. - On 17 March 1711-12 "a report from the Surveyors of the Precincts that the said Parish was divided into precincts - - - and are hereby according to - - - order of the said Vestry - - - Registered verbatum - - - The lands of William Harris, Edwd. Bradley, Capt. Thomas West, John Pettis, James Terry, Lewis Davis, Mr. Munrow, Col. Walker, and Mr. Henry Fox, lying adjacent to each other, being made one precinct." --- On 3 April 1716 the Vestry of St. Paul's Parish ordered another processioning, and the report thereof shows the same names in the same order as that of the first processioning. --- On 10 October 1719 a third processioning was reported and approved, which again included all names recorded in the first report, however, Henry Fox is shown as having been absent from the Parish and that the report was "made by Tenant John Brian". ---

	The land of the said Henry Fox probably was that which on 21 May 1730 he (then of King William County) and Joseph Fox (then-of Hanover County) sold to William Kendrick.  The deed and bond for proper performance of the sales agreement were recorded in Hanover County (Book 1733-1735, page 208) at a court held on 4 November 1734.  The record recites the details of the deed and bond, the second paragraph of the bond reading as follows:
 
"The condition of the above obligation is such that the said William Kendrick having purchased of the above bound Henry Fox a tract of land in Hanover County containing by estimation four hundred acres, more or less, being land whereon Joseph Fox now lives, conveyed by deed bearing Equall date with these presents and the above bound Henry and Joseph doth oblige themselves to maintain and defend the title of the same to the said Kendrick his heirs and assigns forever, now therefore if they the said Henry Fox and Joseph Fox their heirs shall well and truly perform the same and make what further right or title his Counsell learned in the Law shall Lawfully require them then  this obligation to be void and no Effect.  Otherwise to remain in full force power and virtue." - The bond was signed by H. Fox and by Joseph Fox.

	It appears that Henry Fox 2nd had conditionally given the 400 acres of land in Hanover County to his son Joseph Fox, under which condition he continued to exercise some sort of control over it so that the land could not be sold without the signature of both parties (father and son) to the deed.

	As indicated in the Vestry Book of St. Paul's Parish, Henry Fox 2nd moved from that parish prior to 10 October 1719.  He evidently went first to King and Queen County, where he doubtless had a home, and is spoken of as being "an old King and Queen County neighbor  of the father of Samuel Henderson".  The account of Henry Fox, Senior, is contained in the "Account Book of John Baylor, Esqr.", a King and Queen County merchant who died in

30
1719, this account being continued by Baylor's executors into the year 1721, as mentioned in a letter (dated 25 November 1958) from George H. S. King to this writer. - (Account Book of John Baylor Esqr.; Worth S. Ray - Tennessee Cousins, p. 415.)  The record of the said account apparer,tly indicates that Henry Fox, Senior,-- (i.e., Henry Fox 2nd) - was living in King and Queen County in 1721.  However, it is evident that before 14 March of that year he moved to King William County, and subsequently participated in the political, civic, and religious activities of that county.  The following mention is found of him in this connection.

a.  On 2 May 1724 Henry Fox was appointed Sheriff of King William County, and was re-appointed to that office on 4 May 1725. -(Executive Journals, Council of Colonial Virginia, Vol. 4, pp. 66 and 86; Cyclopedia of Virginia Biography, Vol. 1, p. 239; William and Mary College Quarterly, Vol. XX, p.    ; Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol.  8, p.    ; Ellen M. Cocke - Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia, p. 12.)

b.  The records of Colonial Virginia show that Henry Fox was a Justice of the Peace for King William County in 1726. - (Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog., Vol. 48, pp. 143-146.)

c.  In 1730 Henry Fox was a vestryman of St. John's Parish in King William County and served as such until the latter part of that year or the early part of 1731.  On 10 May 1731 Captain James Mason was appointed as a vestryman of St. John's Parish, he "being by a former order chosen a vestryman in the room of Mr. Henry Fox who hath left the Parish".  (Vestry Book of St. John's Parish, printed copy, p. 216; Wm.  Mary Col. Qtrly., Vol. XX, p.    ; Va. Mag. of Hist. & Biog., Vol. 20, p.    ; Cocke - Some Fox Trails in Old Va., p. 12.)

	On 8 September 1728 Henry Fox 2nd of King William County patented "1000 acres of land in St. George's Parish of Spotsylvania County - - - on the north side of the Northana River". - (Land Patent Book No. 13, p. 379.)  On 14 July 1730 he sold this land to Samuel Henderson, of Hanover County, for L 16 sterling. - (Virginia County Records Publications, Vol. 1, 1905, p. 114; Deed Book "B", 1729-1734, p. 84; Worth S. Ray - Tennessee Cousins, p. 415.)  It was this Samuel Henderson whose father was an old King and Queen County neighbor of Henry Fox 2nd.  When Orange County was formed prior to 1742 the said land fell in that county.

	Upon the death of Henry Fox 1st in 1714, and under the law of primogeniture then in force in Virginia, Henry Fox 2nd apparently inherited a large portion (if not the greater part) of his father's landed estates.  The inheritance evidently included the previously mentioned 1000 acres in Gloucester County and (at least) the two following described tracts in King illiam County.  It also might have included the "Huntington" estate on the Mattaponi River, where Henry Fox 2nd perhaps lived until his removal to Brunswick County, Va.  The time and manner of disposal of the "Huntington" estate has not been determined by this writer, nor by any other writer so far as he now knows.
31
King William County Record Book No. 2, p. 94: - On 14 March 1721 Henry Fox of King William County deeded a certain tract of land (acres not known) to John Kendrick.  The record is so badly mutilated that many important details are wholly lost.  However, it does show that Henry Fox of King William County sold a property to John Kendrick of Gloucester County for "seventy pounds sterling money of England", whose metes and bounds touched the lands of Thomas Fox. This document shows that the wife of Henry Fox gave power of attorney to "John Duglas to acknowledge my Right  of Dower". - (Writer's Comment:  The said lands of Thomas Fox, brother of Henry Fox 2nd, doubtless also were an inheritance from his father and evidently were those lands which, together with the lands of "Captain John Fox", another brother, adjoined a tract granted to Thomas West on 23 December 1714.)

Henning - Statutes of Virginia, Vol. VIII, pp. 285-287: - By his will, dated 5 January 1742, Augustine Moore of King William County gave to his son Thomas Moore 62 acres of land in Saint John Parish, King William County, which tract included "the land he bought of the reverend John Fox, - - -with a water grist mill adjoining the land purchased of Fox", this land and grist mill being on Cohoke Swamp. -(Writer's Comment: Neither the number of acres sold by the Reverend John Fox to Augustine Moore nor the date of sale is known.  The land, being situate on Cohoke Swamp, evident,y as part of the 21-acre tract which had been granted to Henry Fox 1st, as shown by Land Patent Book IX, p . 251 .  Henry Fox 2nd probabl y inherited the land from his father, Henry Fox 1st, and gave it to his son the Reverend John Fox at about 1730.) - (See Ellen M. Cocke - Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia, p.

          Henry Fox 2nd moved to Brunswick County probably only a short while before 10 May 1731.  This writer has found no record to show where he lived in that county.  However, Dr. J. Ben Robinson states that "he settled on the south bank of Meherrin River adjacent to Fort Christiana" and designates a tract of land which (as indicated by evidence derived from official documents known to this writer) was more certainly the property of his son Henry Fox 3rd (Colonel) who, after he went to South Carolina, sold it in 1735 to one John Davis.  Henry Fox 2nd doubtless did own lands in BrunswickCounty but, as was true in many other instances, deeds were not recorded or  the records pertaining to those lands probably were lost or destroyed.  As a resident of Brunswick County he participated in the political, civic, and religious activities of that county.  The following mention is found of him in this connection.

a.  On 22 April 1732 Henry Fox, Gentleman, was appointed a justice for the newly created Brunswick County, and was made presiding justice of the County Commission of the Peace. - (Executive Journals, Council of Colonial Virginia, Vol. IV, p. 266; Cyclopedia of Virginia Biography, Vol. 1, p. 239.)  The first meeting of the justices was held on 2 May 1732, with Henry Fox presiding.  He continued to preside as Chief Justice at the meetings of the court until the last record is found of him as a justice.  Evidently in anticipation of the retirement of Henry Fox as a justice, or 4 April
32
1734 the Court of Brunswick County "recommended a number of names to be submitted to the Governor as fit persons to add to the Commission and Henry Fox was "instructed to wait on the Governor with the recommendations".  The last record found of him as a justice was his attendance, as Chief Justice, at a session of the court held on 6 June 1734. - (Brunswick County, Va., Order Book No. 1, various pages.)

	b.  In 1732, when the Brunswick County government was organized, Henry Fox, Gentleman, was designated to represent the county in the House of Burgesses. - Cyclopedia of Virginia Biography, Vol. 1, p. 239.)  His name first appeared in the records of the House for 6 June 1732.  On 6 October 1732 a Brunswick Court was held for laying a county levy, and among the actions taken was one to approve payment of salary to Henry Fox for fifty-two days' service as a Burgess. -(Brunswick County, Va., Order Book No. 1, p. 12.)  In 1732 he prepared and presented to the House a bill for the relief of William West, Gentleman, of King William County; and also represented the House before the Council on a bill to increase the territorial area of Brunswick County. - (Journals of the House of Burgesses for the Assembly of 1727-1734, pp. 136, 152, and 155; Journal of the Council of Colonial Virginia, Vol. II, p. 810.)  The last record of his attendance was 30 August 1734.  The Brunswick County tax levy laid by
the Commissioners on 6 December 1734 included an item for the salary of Henry Fox, Gentleman, as Burgess. - (Brunswick County, Va., Order Book No. 1, p. 78.)

	c .  On 1 March 1 733 Henry Fox, wi th two other persons, was appointed by the Brunswick County court to negotiate with the Court of Prince George County about a bridge over the Nottaway River. -(Brunswick County, Va., Order Book No. 1, p. 18.)

	d.  The Vestry Books of Saint Andrews Parish in Brunswick County show that on 4 July 1733 a vestry was held to discuss the matter of employment and entertainment of John Betty as minister.  Henry Fox (with others) was a signer to the action of the vestry. --- On 16 April 1734 two chapels were ordered to be built in Saint Andrews Parish, one on the south side of the Meherrin River and the other on the north side of that river.  At a vestry held on 16 August 1734 Henry Fox (with others) was appointed to select the place for locating the chapel on the south side of Meherrin River. - (Bell and Heartwell -
"Brunswick Story", published in the Brunswick Times Gazette, Lawrenceville, Va. - Folio 232, B9, B46, in the Congressional Library, Washington, D. C.) --- The last mention of Henry Fox in the vestry books was: -  "At a vestry held 13 October 1735 - - Watt Peterson being firstchosen by the vestry and then sworn vestryman in room of Henry Fox ---" 

	The service of Henry Fox 2nd as a Justice termi nated on or after 6 June 1734; his service as a Burgess terminated at some time between 30 August 1734 and 6 December 1734; and his active connection with the Vestry of Saint Andrews Parish evidently terminated on or shortly before 13 October 1735.  Termination of the said services probablv was occasioned by ill health

33
which forced his retirement.  Records of a later period indicate that he had become indebted in such a manner that during a period of four years or more he was the defendant in at least three complaints filed in the Brunswick County Court.  The cause and exact nature of these complaints are not named in records available to this writer; however, it is clear that the indebtedness was of such extent as to occasion the appointment of a garnishee to hold some of the defendant's property in custody for protection of the plaintiffs against loss pending decisions of the court.  Dr. J. Ben Robinson has advanced a theory (to which he still was an adherent at the time of his last communication with this writer, on 1 July 1969) that at the time of the said complaints Henry Fox 2nd was a resident of the Province of North Carolina.  This theory is based on his contention that it was Henry Fox 2nd, instead of Henry Fox 3rd, who on 18 March 1735 sold the forementioned land to John Davis.  Though the seller then was mentioned as being of the Province of North Carolina he, as explained in Chapter 4, was actually a resident of the Province of South Carolina.  The replacement of Henry Fox 2nd as vestryman of Saint Andrews Parish occurred seven months after Henry Fox of the Province of North Carolina sold the land in erunswick County.  Information concerning the three complaints against Henry Fox 2nd, as known to this writer, does not suggest that he was living in any place other than Brunswick County, Va., during the period 1736-1740.

On July 1, 1736, "An attachment [was] brought by Richard Pourch against George Walton, Garnishee of Henry Fox, for 25 pounds current money - - - the plaintiff being called and he not appearing - - - it is ordered that he be nonsuited." - (Brunswick County, Va., Order Book No. 1, p. 125.)

On April 3, 1740, "In the action of debt between John Reed, Plaintiff, and Henry Fox, defendant, it is ordered that the same be dismissed." - (Brunswick County, Va., Order Book No. 1, p. 86.)

On June 5, 1740, "Thomas Eldridge, Gent., plaintiff, against George Wal ton, Gent ., garni shee of Henry Fox, Gent ., Defendant, upon an attachment; this day came the parties by their attorneys and the said defendant saith that the second plea pleaded and the matter therein contained are good and sufficient in law to preclude the said Thomas from having condemnation of the goods and chattels, rights and credits of the said Henry Fox, Gentleman, - - - the said Thomas hath not answered - - - but because the court here before their judgement of and upon the premises they render will advise day is given the parties here until next court to hear thereof their judgement." - (Brunswick County, Va., Order Book No. 1,p. 305-)

	   It is probable that Henry Fox 2nd had, at least, one daughter in addition to the four sons previously mentioned in this section of Chapter 3. The following information is given concerning these children.

	    a.  Henry 3rd - (See Chapter 4.)

34
	   b. Joseph (b. in 1702; d. in December 1749, aged 47 years). -He married Susanna Smith (b. in 17n7; d. 1 July 1790), of Spottsyvania County, "Marriage Licence 1 "having been issued to him on 6 Auust 1729. - (Spottsylvania Will Book "A"; Crozier - Spottsylvania County Records, p. 84; E. P. Valentine Papers, Vol. 4, p. 2317.)

 	As previously mentioned in this section of Chapter 3, on 21 May 1730 Joseph Fox and his father (Henry Fox 2nd) sold a tract of land in Hanover County to William Kendrick.  In 1732 he submitted two petitions for land, both of which were granted. - (Executive Journals, Council of Colonial  Virginia. Vol. 4, pp. 277  283).  In 1735 he was granted 400 acres of land in Hanover  (now Louisa) County. - (Wm. Mary Col. Qtrly.,Vol. 2.", p..)  In 1736 he acquired 1000 acres of land in Orange County, wllich he advertised for sale in 1738. - (Land Patent Book No. 17, p. 224; Virginia Gazette of 21 April 1738).  On 3 February 1749 , he "Joseph Fox, Gentleman, of Louisa County", sold 261 acres of land to Nelson Anderson. - (Louisa County Deed Book "A", p. 342.)

	Joseph Fox left a will which is referred to in a deed to which one of his sons was a party, and his estate is mentioned in 1750 in the Ledger of a Hanover County Merchant. - (Louisa County Deed Book "D1", p. 341; Ledger in Archives Division of Virginia State Library.)  The will of his wife was probated on 13 September 1790. - (Louisa County Will Book 3. p. 193.)  An old prayer book owned by a descendant lists
their children as follows- - Joseph, Ann, Thomas, Susannah, Elizabeth, John, Frannis, Anes, Katy, and Sarah.

	Some students of Fox family history have erroneously named this Joseh Fox as a son of "Captain John Fox (b. ca. 1676)".


 	   c.  Unity ? (b. ca. 1704) - Tllis robable daughter perhaps married Jolln Carroll. The said Carroll owned lands in Brunswick County adjoining a tract which Henry Fox 3rd sold to John Davis on 18 March 1735. -(Deed Book 1,  1732-1740, pp. 159 & 160.)  Some of the sons of John and Unity Fox?  Carroll apparently were William, Jacob, and Edmund Carroll, who at a later date were associated with the family of Henry Fox 3rd
in Richland lounty, 8.C.  In 1770 a tract of 100 acres of land was ordered for Willim Fox (son of Henry Fox 3rd), the said land having been previously surveyed for Edward/Edmund Carroll in 1767.  William Fox, William Carroll, and Jacob Carroll served together as soldiers from Riclland County during the Revolutionary War.  The Will (14 Apr. 1815 - 21 June 1815) of Jacob Carroll Sr., in addition to five sons names his daughter Unity who married Joseph Collins. - (Greene - History of Richland County, S.C., pp. 65, 93, and 259; 1790 and 1810 Federal Censuses for Richland County, S.C.) - Sarah Carroll (thought to be a sister of William, Jacob, and Edmund Carroll) married the forementioned William Fox.  It is tradition among their descendants that William Fox and Sarah Carroll were cousins.  (Faucette - Outline of Fox Family History.)


35
	   d.  John (b. in 1706; lvg. in 1769). - In 1737 he married Mrs. Isabel (Booth) Richards, widow of the Reverend John Richards. - (E. M. Cocke - Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia, p. 23; Mag. of Va. Hist. & Biog., Vol. 8, p.    ; Ency. of Va. Biog., VQ1 1, p. 239.)

      John Fox was for seven years a student at William and Mary College at Williamsburg, Va.  In 1729 he was usher (assistant teacher) in the grammar school there, and during 1730-1737 he was Master of the Indian School at the College.  On 10 June 1731 he was "in his 25th year of age" and was desirous to be ordained a minister.  Shortly thereafter he went to London where he was ordained on 11 September 1731.  Returning to Virginia he continued his service in the Indian School until 1737, and in that year he was appointed Rector of Ware Parish in Gloucester County in which office he probably served until as late as the year 1769. - (E. M. Cocke - Some Fox Trails in Old Virginia, p. 23; Mag. of Va. Hist. & Biog., Vol. 8, p.    ; Wm. & Mary Col. Qtrly., Vol. 20, 2nd Series - 1940, p. 115; Ency. of Va. Biog., Vol. 1, p. 239.)

      	As heretofore indicated the Reverend John Fox inherited a one-half share of a lOOO-acre tract of land in Gloucester County and other lands in King William County.  He also bought his brother William's share of the said lOOO-acre tract of land.

      	The wife (Isabel) of the Reverend John Fox died on 13 June 1742, age 38 years. The arms engraved on her tomb are the arms of Fox of Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England. - (Va. County Record Publications, Vol. 5, p. 9 - Fox, Gloucester County; Wm. & Mary Col. Qtrly., Vol. 3, p. 168.)  The children of this couple were:  Mary, Susanna, and John. - (Tyler's Qtrly. Mag., Vol. 21, p. 224.)

      	Some students of Fox family history have erroneously named the Reverend John Fox as a son of "Captain John Fox (b. ca. 1676)".

      	   e.  William (b. ca. 1710; d. in 1764) - At about 1734 he married Sarah Avent.  He settled in Brunswick County where he died leaving a will. The will (22 December 1763 - 23 January 1764) names his wife Sarah, and children:  Betty (md. John Rives), Lucy (md. William Robinson), William (md. Martha/Patsy Rives), Thomas Avent (md. Lavinia Smith - 2nd wife?), John (md. Celia Bonner), Mary Claiborne (md. Thomas? Johnson), Sarah (md. --- Robinson?), and Noona/Unity (md. William Harrell and perhaps, 2ndly, Jesse Mitchell).  - (J. R. Childs - Reliques of the Rives, p. Brunswick County Will Book 4, p. 387; Genealogical notes written in 1894 by Mrs. Sarah Elizabeth, nee Love, Peck of Alabama; data from files of Mrs. J. H. Colson of Gainesville, Fla.)

      As heretofore indicated, William Fox inherited a one-half share of  a lOOO-acre tract of land in Gloucester County.  He sold this share to his brother, the Reverend John Fox.  He owned lands in Brunswick County also.  Some students of Fox family history have erroneously identified the William Fox who owned the lands in Gloucester County as being the son of "Captain John Fox (b. ca. 1676)."

It is said that William Fox first lived on the western side of Fontaine Creek in the present Greensville County, Va., and later lived on the eastern side of that creek on a large plantation left to his wife by her father, Colonel Thomas Avent of Sussex County, Va.  Data of Dr. J. Ben Robinson.)


	It has been stated by some writers that Henry Fox 2nd and his wife Mary Kendrick were the parents of Richard Fox (b. ca. 1710; d. 1771) of Mecklenburg County, Va.  This writer believes the statement to be incorrect. - See Chapter 3 - Section 2. - Some Family Connections of Mary Kendrick (Wife of Henry Fox 2nd).

CHAPTER 3 - SECTION 2 

SOME FAMILY CONNECTIONS OF MARY KENDICK (WIFE OF HENRY FOX 2nd)

	Tradition in the Kendrick family recites that: -"Five Kendrick brothers came to Gloucester County, Va.  Two of them settled there, and the other three went north.  One of the two who remained in Gloucester County was William Kendrick.  He had a daughter Mary (b. ca. 1678) who married Henry Fox 2nd and a son John (b. ca. 1680)."  John Kendrick, the brother of Mary Kendrick, married (name of wife not determined) and became the father of three known children (as per letter of Dr. J. Ben Robinson, 25 June 1968), namely:

         1.  William (b. 1704; d. 1777). - (See following.)
         2.  James (b. ca. 1706).
         3.  Mary (b. 27 March 1709). - Baptized 29 arch 1709 at
   Abingdon Parish Church, Gloucester County, Va. - (Parish Register, Vol. II, p. 28.)

	William Kendrick (b. 1704; d. 1777) married Sarah Jones (d. 1795) in 1726.  Both of them died testate in North Carolina, his will being recorded in Bute County Will Book No. 2, pp. 119-121, and her will being recorded in Warren County Will Book No. 8, pp. 236-238.  Their ten (10) children were:

         1.  James (b. ca. 1732). - Md. Susannah Roberson.
         2.  John (b. 1734). - Md. Amy Fox in 1760.
         3.  Sarah (b. 1736). - Md. Benjamin Thornton.
         4.  Mary (b. 1738; d. 1795). - (See following.)
         5.  Benjamin (b. ca. 1740; d. before 1777).
         6.  Rebecca (b. ca. 1743). - Md.______ Nicholson.
         7.  Martin (b. 1745). - Md. Susannah Thompson.
         8.  Martha (b. 1747). - Md. William Wood.
         9.  Jones (b. 1750). - Md. Margaret______
        10.  Isham (b. ca. 1755). - Md. (l) Elizabeth Tucker
                                                      and (2) Elizabeth Duncan.

	Mary Kendrick (b. 1738; d. 1795) married William Fox (b. 1732; d. 1783) in 1758.  He was a brother of Amy Fox who married John Kendrick, as heretofore mentioned.  The will of William Fox was proved in Mecklenburg County, Va., -(W. & M. College Quarterly, Vol. XX, 1917-1918, pp. 262 to 266.)  He names his children as follows:

           1.  Arthur - Md. Mary Young ?
           2.  Richard (b. 1764, d. 1833). - (See following.)
           3.  William - ?
           4.  Henry - Md. (l) Sally Kendrick; Md. (2) Sarah Parks.
           5.  Benjamin - Md. Martha Norvall.
           6.  Mary Kendrick Fox - Md. Thomas Williams ?
           7.  Sally Jones Fox - Md. Thomas Norvall.
           8.  Joanna Fox - Md . Samuel Hol mes .

	Richard Fox (b. 1764; d. 1833) married Mary Blanton (b. 1772; d. 1862) in 1788.  According to his family bible record he had a daughter Martha Fox (b. 1800; d. 1864) who in 1825 married Dandridge Claiborne Freeman (b. 1794; d. 1866), this marriage being recorded in the Freeman family bible.  Dandridge Claiborne Freeman was a great-grandson of Anne Fox (b. 1684; d. 1733) who married Thomas Claiborne (b. 1680; d. 1732) about 1701.  Mrs. Rosa C. (Freeman) Ferrell, granddaughter of Dandridge Claiborne Freeman and his wife Martha Fox, accomplished some genealogical research on several of her family lines and claimed that her grandfather "married his cousin".  In 1958 Mrs. Margaret (Jones) Merchant, a niece of Mrs. Ferrell, in a letter to Dr. J. Ben Robinson repeated her aunt's claim in the words - I'Richard Fox married Mary Blanton and their daughter Martha married my great-grandfather D. C. Freeman, Sr., who was her cousin".  It is nowhere stated how this 'Icousinll relationship came about; however, Mrs. Merchantls statement in her letter to Dr. Robinson seems to indicate that the said relationship (in some degree) was due to the marriage of Mary Blanton to Richard Fox, and that D. C. Freeman and Mary Blanton had a common ancestor somewhere back in their lines of descent.

	The grandfather of Richard Fox (b. 1764; d. 1833) was an older Richard Fox (b. ca. 1710, d. 1771) of Mecklenburg County, Va.  In an effort to explain the forementioned "cousin" relationship Dr. Robinson has advanced, and ardently contends for, the theory that the older Richard Fox was a son of Henry Fox 2nd and his wife Mary Kendrick.  This he does despite the fact that neither Mrs. Ferrell nor Mrs. Merchant in any way indicates that Henry Fox 2nd was included in their ancestry, and despite Dr. Robinson's own statement (letter of 11 June 1968 to this writer) that - "To my knowledge no recorded evidence which proves the parentage of Col. Richard Fox has so far been revealed."  Dr. Robinson based his theory largely on he fact that Henry Fox 2nd and the older Richard Fox lived in adjoining counties in Virginia and that both of them had business and/or social contacts with members of the Kendrick family.  The fact that these two persons ived in adjoining counties proves nothing as to a family relationship between them, and since both Henry Fox 2nd and 2 children of the older
Richard Fox married into the Kendrick family it is natural that the mentioned business and/or social contacts occurred  If all of the intermarriages in the ancestral lines of Dandridge Claiborne Freeman and of Martha Fox were known their common ancestor could well have been one of any number of persons without Henry Fox 2nd being in any way involved.  The nearest approach to a "cousin" relationship between Dandridge Claiborne Freeman and his wife Martha Fox as would involve Henry Fox 2nd evidently lies in the following.

1.  Mary Kendrick, the first wife of Henry Fox 2nd, was an aunt-by-blood (4 times removed) of Martha Fox, while Henry Fox 2nd was her uncle-by-law (4 times removed).

2.  Mary Kendrick, the first wife of Henry Fox 2nd, was a aunt-by-law (3 times removed) of Dandridge Claiborne Freeman, while Henry Fox 2nd was his uncle-by-blood (3 times removed.)
39
3.  Mary Claiborne, the second wife of Henry Fox 2nd, was first cousin-by-blood (3 times removed) to Dandridge Claiborne Freeman, while Henry Fox 2nd was his uncle-by-blood (3 times removed) or his first cousin-by-law (3 times removed).

4.  Mary Claiborne, the second wife of Henry Fox 2nd, was an  aunt-by-courtesy (4 times removed) of Martha Fox, while Henry Fox 2nd was her uncle-by-law (4 times removed) or her first cousin-by-law (3 times removed).

	The foregoing shows no blood relationship between Dandridge Claiborne Freeman and Martha Fox but it does show their common interest in Henry Fox 2nd because of his marriages to Mary Kendrick and Mary Claiborne. This complex common interest apparently developed into the close relationship of 'Icousin-by-courtesy'' among the foreparents of Dandridge Claiborne Freeman and of Martha Fox, and later was assumed to be the relationship of "cousin-by-blood".

	The parentage of Richard Fox (b. ca. 1710; d. 1771) has been a "guessing game" among several persons other than Dr. Robinson.  The writer of a Fox family sketch published in the William and Mary College Quarterly, Vol. XX, pp. 262-266, places him as the son of Thomas Fox (brother of Henry Fox 2nd).  A Colonel Joseph Dinkins, one of his descendants, places him as the son of Henry Fox 1st and Anne West.  Mr. George H. S. King, a Fox family genealogist, places him as the son of George and Mary (Mowbray) Fox of Surry County, Va.  Miss Marguerite S. Banks, one of his descendants, states - "Some say he was the son of George Fox who died in Surry County in 1711 and others think he was the son of Henry Fox, the son of Henry-Anne West."  Mrs. George Willis Bonte (nee Louise Quarles), who prepared a book of Fox family collectanea, wrote:  "Henry Fox married Mary Claiborne.  Said to have had a son Richard Fox who married Hannah Williamson."  The author of an old manuscript (written apparently during the early l900"s) in possession of a Miss Cocke of Roanoke, Va., in 1952, states:  "Henry Fox married Mary Kendrick and had at least two sons, one William and one Colonel Richard Fox who married Hannah Williamson"; - however, no proof for this positive statement is cited.

	During the late 1930's Mrs. Josephine (Cortner) Zeitler-Hill, who in 1970 was living in Mooresville, Ala., prepared application forms for her two daughters who desired to become members of The Society of Colonial Dames.  On the said forms she entered a statement which reads: - "Henry Fox, Gentleman of Brunswick County, Virginia.  He deeds land to his two sons William Fox and Richard Fox."  As authority for this statement Mrs. Hill referred to "Brunswick County Order Book 1, page 1, May Court 1732".  The first two pages of Order Book 1 were destroyed at some time between 1912 and May 1916; however, at about 1912 the late Mrs. J. 0. James of Petersburg, Va., made copies of the said pages (before their destruction) and these were later contributed by her for use in a Bulletin of Virginia State Library (Vol. 9, p. 75, footnote 11) issued in 1916.  The said copies show that the now missing pages were concerned only with the proceedings of the first court for Brunswick County and had nothing whatsoever to say about Henry Fox deeding lands to William Fox and Richard Fox.  No such deed of record has been 

40


found in Brunswick County.  A later order book entry lists the names of fifty persons who then held unrecorded deeds, but the name of Henry Fox does not appear in the list.  On July 9, 1970, Miss Shirley Faucette of Clinton, Miss., visited Mrs. Josephine (Cortner) Zeitler-Hill and discussed with her the deed claimed to have been given by Henry Fox to his "sons William and Richard", as mentioned in her records.  All that Mrs. Zeitler-Hill could specifically remember regarding the said deed was that the information was sent to her bv "a researcher" - (whose name she did not mention) - during the late 1930's.  In view of the circumstances involved, the claim of such a deed having been given by Henry Fox has the appearance of being a hoax (in which the missing pages of Order Book 1 would be a "cover-up") intended to establish the identity of Richard Fox as being the son of Henry Fox 2nd. Mrs. Zeitler-Hill is recorded as being a descendant of William Fox (son of the said Henry Fox 2nd), and has no interest in Richard Fox as an ancestor.

	This writer's belief is that Richard Fox (b. ca. 1710; d. 1771) of Mecklenburg County, Va., was the son of George and Mary Fox of Surry County, Va., and the grandson of Richard (Jr.) and Mary Fox who settled in Chowan Precinct, N.C. prior to or during 1700.  George Fox, the son of Richard (Jr.) and Mary Fox died (in 1710/11) in Surry County, Va.  He had a brother John who lived in Prince George County, Va., a few years prior to 1713 and then returned to Chowan Precinct, N.C.  One Cornelius Fox, whose name appeared for the first time in the court records of Prince George County on 9 February 1720, probably was another brother.  Cornelius, whose death is recorded in the Bristol Parish Register in 1754, has been suggested as being the father of one Samuel Fox of Nelson County, Va., who had among his eight children a son by the name of Richard Fox.  Richard (Jr.) was the son of Richard (Sr.) and Mary Fox who, with two other sons (George and william) were imported into North Carolina during or before 1694.  Richard Fox who was born about 1710 and died in 1771 married (about 1731) Hannah Williamson of Surry County, Va., and in 1736 he settled in the present Mecklenbura .aunty. -(Records of Perquimans Precinct Court, N.C., Feb. 1693-4; Colonial Records of N.C., Vol. 1, pp. 394, 396, and 563; Ibid., Vol. 2, p. 241; E. G. Winslow -History of Perquimans County, N.C., pp. 8, 52, and 449; N.C. Hist. & Gen. Reg., Vol. 1, pp. 86 and 301; Chowan County, N.C., Deed Book "W", pp. 22, 23, and 105; Surry County, Va., Orders, 1691-1713, p. 388; Surry County Va., Deeds, etc. No. 5, 1694-1709, p. 108; Surry County, Va., Will Book 8, p. 196 - Will of John Williamson.) - The forementioned Miss Marguerite S. Banks, one of his descendants, states that John Williamson the father of Hannah (wife of Richard Fox) "was for much of his life in Prince George County".  It seems to have been more than coincidence that Richard Fox (b. ca. 1710; d. 1771) bore the same given name as the two Richard Foxes of North Carolina -The first appearance of this name amon the acknowledged descendants of Henry Fox 1st did not occur until many years later.); that he evidently married in Surry County, Va., where George Fox died; and that he settled in a locality immediately adjoining the original Prince George County, Va., in which both John Fox and Cornelius Fox had or then lived, and also imme-diately adjoining the original Chowan Precinct, N.C., in which Richard Fox, Jr., lived.  Richard Fox (b. ca. 1710; d. 1771) owned and lived upon land on the south side of Roanoke River, within the narrow corridor between thatriver and the North Carolina line.

41
	

	Until the year 1722 (when Bertie Precinct was formed) Chowan Precinct, N.C., embraced a wide strip of territory bounded northward by the dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina and extending from the present Perquimans County to "as far as the lim-its of this government".  The adjoining Virginia counties of the time, from east to west, were Nansemond (in part), Isle of Wight (included Southampton and the lower part of Greensville), Surry (included Sussex, the upper part of Greensville, the lower part of Brunswick until 1720, and the southeastern corner of Mecklenburg), and Prince George (included Dinwiddie, the upper part of Brunswick until 1720, Lunenburg, and the remainder of Mecklen)urg). - (D. L. Corbitt -The Formation of the North Carolina Counties, 1663-1943, p. 65; eade - Old Churches, Ministers, and Families of Virginia, Vol. 1, pp. 299, 308, etc.; Henning - Statutes At Large, Vols. , pp. .)

	From the records available to this writer, it appcars that Richard Fox, Jr., first settled in the eastern part of Chowan Precinct, where he acquired 258 acres of land which he and his wife ary conveyed to Jon White, Jr., on 23 November 1700. - (Chowan County, N.C., Deed Book W, pp. 22  23.)  It is probable that he then, or soon thereafter, moved with the tide of emigration westward along the course of the Roanoke River (navigable for small boats up to or beyond the North Carolina-Virginia boundary line) and settled on or near that river just below the point where the adjoininy original Prince George and Surrey Counties, Va., touched on the original Chowan Precinct, N.C.  Here he acquired a 640-acre tract of land (situated on Salmon Creek) which at his death (prior to 1710) was left to his son George Fox.  On 8 January 1710 George, then a resident of Surry County, Va., sold the said land to his mother (Mary) who then was the wife of one Carew/Carey Godby. - (Chowan County, N.C., Deed Book W, p. 105.)  The saidCarew/Carey Godby is mentioned, on 3 August 1716, as being the "Father in Law (step-father)" of John Fox who in 1713 returned to Chowan Precinct, N.C., from Prince George County, Va. - (Colonial Records of North Carolina, 1713-1728, Vol. 2, p. 241.  This record shows tha John Fox was desirous to "learn to be a ship carpenter", - probably to build small boats for use in navigable waters of the Roanoke River extending from the community where his parents lived down to or beyond the entrance of that river into Albemarle  Sound.)

	George Fox of Chowan Precinct, N.C., and Surry County, Va., who died in 1710/11, apparently was born about 1688, married in early 1710 (after 8 January 1710, being then a very young man), and was the father of but one child.  As previously stated herein, this writer believes that the said child was Richard Fox (b. ca. 1710; d. 1771) of Mecklenburg County, Va., whose year of birth has been estimated as being anywhere from 1701 to 1711. George Fox married Mary Maybury, and since she did not sign a dower release in the deed from George Fox to his mother Mary odby) of 8 January 1710 it seems evident that the marriage took place after that date.  On 20 February 1711 she (as the widow of George Fox) appeared in the Surry County Court and "relinquished her right of administration" of her late husband's estde to her brother, Francis Maybury, Jr.  An inventory of George Fox's estate was recorded in Surry County, Va., on 20 August 1712, which inventory showed that Fox left a personal estate appraised at 20 pounds, 1 shilling, and 6 pence.  Such a small personal estate would indicate that he then was a young man who had not yet accumulated a large estate. - (Surry County, Va., Court Orders, 1691-1713, p. 388; Surry County, Va., Deeds, etc.. No. 5, 1694-1709, P. 108.)

	On 21 May 1730 the forementioned William Kendrick, being then of King William County, Va., bought of Henry Fox 2nd and Joseph Fox (these being, respectively, his uncle by marriage and his first cousin) a tract of land situated in Hanover County, Va. - (Hanover County, Va., Record Book, 1733-1735, p. 208.)  He apparently soon thereafter moved to Hanover County and lived there until about 1739, when he moved to that part of the original Bertie County, N.C., which successively through the passing years became Edgecombe County, Granville County, Bute County, and now is Warren County.  In this new location he acquired lands on Shocco Creek, a few miles below the home of Richard Fox who then lived in the present Mecklenburg County, Va. (Letters of Dr. J. Ben Robinson to this writer, dated 10 November 1966 and 11 June 1968.) He was a party to many land transactions, principally in, Granville County, one of these occurring on 4 June 1754 when he "sold to Gideon Macon - - - 200 acres - - - in Granville County on the northside of Shocco Creek---.- (Granville County, N.C., Deed Book B, p. 388.)  It probably was at this time that William Kendrick and Richard Fox and their families first became acquainted with each other.  The acquaintanceship led to a later marriage of two of William Kendrikls children to two of Richard Fox's children.  This writer believes that from these marriages alone arose a later confused claim of llcousinll relationship between the marrying parties (as heretofore mentioned), which in turn gave rise to the erroneous claim that Richard Fox WaS the son of Henry Fox 2nd.  It is further believed (as previously stated) that Richard Fox of Mecklenburg County, Va., was the son of George Fox of Surry County, Va., the grandson of Richard Fox (Jr.) of Chowan Precinct, N.C., and the great-grandson of Richard Fox (Sr.) of Perquimans Precinct, N.C.  However, the writer will stand corrected in the event that valid documentary proof to the contrary is hereafter presented.

CHAPTER 4

HENRY FOX  3rd

	
	The identity of Henry Fox 3rd (b. ca. 1698; d. 1770) in Virginia is established by the record of his father (Henry Fox 2nd) in the previously mentioned "Account Book of John Baylor, Esqr.", though the son himself (Henry Fox 3rd) is not named in that record.  John Baylor (a merchant of King and Queen County) died in 1719 and his "account book" carried the open account of "Henry Fox, Senior", which account Baylor's executors continued into the year 1721.  The naming of "Henry Fox, Senior", -(i.e., Henry Fox 2nd) - furnishes proof that there was a "Henry Fox, Junior", - (i.e., Henry Fox 3rd).  It appears that in 1719 both father and son were living in King and Queen County and that the father continued to live there until early 1721 and then moved to King William County.

	Apparently at about 1720/21 Henry Fox 3rd moved to the newly formed Brunswick County, Va., and shortly afterwards - in 1722/3 - married his first wife (thought to have been Mary Goodwyn) whose family settled in the present adjoining Dinwiddie County.

	In view of his activity in connection with Indian affairs in South Carolina, after he went to that province, this writer believes that when Henry Fox 3rd moved to Brunswick County he became associated in some capacity with the Virginia Indian Company having control of all trade with the Indians south of the James River.  In 1714, at the direction of Governor Spotswood, Fort Christiana was built on the south bank of the Meherrin River about two miles west of the present town of Lawrenceville in Brunswick County.  Upon its completion the fort was placed under the authority of the organization of influential frontiersmen which formed the said Virginia Indian Company.  Doubtless it was here that Henry Fox 3rd became experienced in Indian affairs and in military activities which gained for him the title of "Colonel" in Brunswick County and in South Carolina.  An Indian Village was located near the fort and at that point the Company operated a successful Indian school under the administration of the Reverend Charles Griffen. Prior to or during 1730 the Virginia Indian Company ceased operations; and, on 10 December 1730, the Council and Court of Virginia specified certain land about the fort to be reserved for those who had made investments in theproject.  The reservation included "One thousand acres of land on the south side of the Mehherrin River and extending up and down the said River and back into the woods equi-distant from the center of the ffort of Christiana, and one thousand acres on the north side of the said River Meherrin running parallel to the said former tract to be laid off and assigned to persons interested in the said late Virqinia Indian Company". - (See Brunswick Times Gazeteer Point, Lawrenceville, Va., 1924, - Address by Edward P. Buford; Erection of Monument, Fort Christiana, by the Society of Colonial Dames of America, May 22, 1924.)

As heretofore mentioned (in Chapter 3), Henry Fox 3rd was the owner of land in Brunswick County.  The said land consisted of 190 acres on the banks of the south side of the Maherin River" and 365 acres "bordering


44

on the road to ffort Christiana", totalling 555 acres the metes and bounds of which when sold touched the lands of John Wall and John Carrill.  The date and manner of acquiring this land have not been determined; however, its location suggests that at least the 190 acres might have been part of the forementioned 2000 acres "assigned to persons interested in the said late Virginia Indian Company," which further suggests that Henry Fox 3rd might have had an interest (or was an investor) in the said company.  On 18 March 1735 h-deeded the said land (555 acres) to John Davis, Welshman, of Brunswick County, Va., for L 35.10S.  He then was actually a resident of South Carolina, but in the deed he described himself as "of the Province of North Carolina" see following).  At the time of making the deed he and his wife evidently had returned to Brunswick County for that purpose, which is confirmed by the fact that the deed was signed by himself in person, witnessed by local persons, and that his wife was present in Brunswick County. -(Brunswick County Deeds and Will Book No. 1, 1732-1740, pp. 159-160; Order Book No. 1, p. 85.)  The late Mrs. J. 0. James of Petersburg, Va., a descendant of William Fox the brother of Henry Fox 3rd, claimed to have found an item in a Brunswick County record which stated that "Mary Fox the wife of Henry Fox had been unable to attend court and sign the deed of transfer; therefore, a committee of two was appointed to wait on her and secure her signature".  However, the said item could not be located by a genealogist who in a later year made a search for it.  The record probably was destroyed prior to May 1916, before which time Mrs. James had made a copy of the also destroyed pages 1 and 2 of Brunswick County Order Book No. 1. - (Mrs. James contributed the copy of the said pages of Order Book No. 1 to the Virginia State Library for use in a bulletin issued in 1916.  The destruction of those pages of the order book and the contribution made by Mrs. James are mentioned in the said bulletin.)

	According to a statement made by himself on 31 December 1753, Henry Fox went to the Province of South Carolina in 1733.  He arrived there probably during the middle part (l April to 30 September) of 1733, when weather conditions were most favorable for moving his family.   He first settled in what now is Marlboro County, S.C., evidently on land originally granted by North Carolina officials, and had his home there when he sold the land in Brunswick County, Va.  Marlboro County then was part of a large strip of territory south of the present North Carolina-South Carolina boundarv line and which was in dispute between the two provinces.  The disputed area extended fro the present Pickens County to the present Horry County along the said boundary line, and had a depth of from five to forty miles within the limits of the present State of South Carolina.  Land within the said strip was granted either by North Carolina officials or by South Carolina officials and, according to the source of the grant, the inhabitants considered themselves as being either "of the Province of North Carolina" or "of the Province of South Carolina". - (Leonardo Andrea - South Carolina Colonial Soldiers and Patriots, p. 3; Howe - The Presbyterian Church in South Carolina, Vol. 1, p. 285.)  During the period of 1728-1734 the land area of Marlboro County was claimed by North Carolina as part of her New Hanover County and later was claimed as part of her Bladen County (formed in 1734), while at the same time it was claimed by South Carolina as part of her Craven County (a proprietary county in 1682 and later extended).  Though the "Colony of Carolina" was divided into two provinces in 1729 the contention as to a dividing line was not finally settled until towards the middle of 1735, and the actual survey of the



45


line was not completed until 4 December 1928.  The dividing line which was agreed upon gave to South Carolina, on its eastern side, all of the land area included in the present Counties of Marlboro, Dillon, Marion, and Horry, and gave to North Carolina all of the disputed territory eastward from those counties. - (James Sprunt Historical Studies, Vol. 25, Part 1, pp. 37 et seq., - "North Carolina Boundary Disputes Involving Her Southern Line", by Marvin L. Skaggs, authenticated by references to North Carolina and South Carolina Colonial Records; Helen Kohn Hennig - Great South Carolinians, Vol. 1, pp. 22 and 23.)  In the late 1700's and early 1800's the Legislature of South Carolina, through proper state officials, issued new grants to supersede those previously made by North Carolina officials for lands lying within the established borders of the State of South Carolina. - (See South Carolina land grant books for the period.)

	At this point an explanation is needed concerning the names by which certain geographical areas in South Carolina were designated prior to 1800.  The proprietary counties in 1682 were Granville, Colleton, Berkeley, and Craven, each of which extended fifty miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean.  With growing settlements in the back country during the colonial period, these four counties were later extended to the North Carolina line. Charleston was the county seat of all four counties, and from 1670 to 1782-85 all court records, wills, administrations, and deeds were recorded, and still are to be found, in the Charleston County Courthouse.  Craven County was the largest of the colonial counties.  It included the land area of the present Counties of Georgetown, Horry, Williamsburg, Clarendon, Florence, Marion, Dillon, Marlboro, Chesterfield, Darlington, Lee, Sumter, Kershaw, Lancaster, York, Chester, Fairfield, and Richland. - (Leonardo Andrea - South Carolina Colonial Soldiers and Patriots, pp. 3 and 4; Kirkland and Kennedy - Historic Camden, S.C., Vol. 2, Chapter XX, pp. 251 and 252; History of Williamsburg, S.C., pp. 9, 53, 188, and 257; DAR Habersham [Georgia] Chapter Historical Collections, Vol. 3, p. 14 - The Logan Ms. - Craven County.)  A set of maps entitled "Guide Maps to Development of S.C. Parishes, Districts, and Counties - Compiled in the S.C. Archives Department from Maps in S.C.
Inventories made by the WPA Historical Records Survey" can be obtained from the South Carolina Archives Department, Columbia, S.C., at a nominal cost (fifty cents?).  One of the maps included in the set shows the four proprietary counties of South Carolina as they existed in 1682.

	With the establishment of parishes as ecclesiastical divisions in South Carolina, in 1721 the entire land area of Craven County was designated as Prince George Parish, Winyah.  From the previously given description of Craven County it will be seen that the said area included all land extending eastward from the Broad, Congaree, and Santee Rivers to the Atlantic Ocean.  - - - In 1734 Prince Frederick Parish, Winyah, was created from that part of Prince George which lay east of the said rivers, south of the North Carolina line, west of the Pee Dee River, and north of the present Georgetown County. By the Act creating the new parish, the then existing parish church of Prince George became the parish church of Prince Frederick.  This church (begun in 1726 and finished in 1734) was located at "Brown's Ferry over Black River", about twenty miles southwest of the present town of Plantersville in Georgetown County, being in the present Williamsburg County near the point where the boundary line between the two said counties crosses the Black River.  It will be seen that thus the parish church of Prince Frederick

46



served the inhabitants of an extensive land area. - (Mrs. E. W. A. Pringle -the Register Book for the Parish of Prince Frederick, Winyah; S C H & G Magazine, Vol. XVIII, 1917, p. 91; Dalcho - Episcopal Church in South Carolina, p. 319.) - - - In 1737 a Welsh colony settled along the eastern side of the upper Pee Dee River, in Prince George Parish, Winyah, and their settlement became known as the "Welsh Tract".  The Welsh Tract extended from five miles above the present town of Cheraw to three miles below Cashway Ferry, - or fifty-seven miles along the winding Pee Dee River, - and lay principally within the bounds of the present Marlboro County. - - - In 1757 Saint Mark Parish was cut off from Prince Frederick Parish, Winyah; and in 1768, when judicial precincts were established in the province, the land area of Saint Mark Parish was designated as Camden District.  In 1785 the Camden District was subdivided into seven counties, the names of which were: -Chester, Claremont, Clarendon, Fairfield, Lancaster, Richland, and York. - - - In 1768 Saint David Parish was formed from parts of Prince Frederick Parish Winyah, and Prince George Parish, Winyah, and in the same year its area, as a judicial Precinct, was designated as Cheraws District.  In 1785 the Cheraws District was subdivided into three counties, the names of which were: - Chesterfield, Darlington, and Marlboro. - - - The northern part (Chester, Lancaster, and York Counties) of the Camden District and the greater part of the Cheraws District were included in the previously mentioned strip of territory which was in dispute between the Province of North Carolina and the Province of South Carolina.

	From an article (with documental references) written by Miss Eleanor T. McColl, under the title "Place Names In Marlboro County", the following is learned regarding the early interest of the South Carolina Provincial Government (apart from the interest of the North Carolina Provincial Government) in the area.  This article was published in Vol. XVI (Winter, 1969, - See pages 12 and 13) of "Names In South Carolina".

"Despite early offers of land grants, it was not until 1736, or early 1737, that any permanent (underlining by this writer) settlement was made here. - - - As mentioned earlier, the first settlements and the first grants of land began about 1734 and were in close proximity to the Great Pee Dee River.  The next settlers took up land along the more important creeks, - - -.  It is also interesting to note the earliest creeks to attract settlers were given 'natural' names:  Crooked, Beaverdam, Naked, Muddy (underlining by this writer). - - - One of the remarkable facts of county history is the almost total disappearance of the names of early settlers and of those families who succeeded them.  In Marlboro County, the names of the first settlers were unknown by the time of the Revolution; the names of those prominent in the Revolution were unknown after that period."

	The land on which Henry Fox 3rd first settled (in 1733) in Marlboro County either had been granted directly to him by the Governor of the Province of North Carolina or transferred to him by deed from a private party who previously had acquired it by grant from the said governor. -(Hence his later mention as "Henry Fox of the Province of North Carolina".) -

 47


In view of the counter claims of the two provinces and the loss of many colonial records, it perhaps now would be very difficult to trace the history (date and manner of acquisition and disposition) of this tract of land.  However, the said tract evidently was that (for which this writer has not found a South Carolina grant or deed) mentioned on pages 63 and 64 of H. T. Cook's "Rambles In The Pee Dee Basin of South Carolina" as being situated on Muddy Creek and as being adjoined on the south by land of Colonel Thomas Hume and on the north by land of Thomas Groom. - (On the lower Muddy Creek, around the Fox-hume-Groom lands, were the lands of John Newberry, Tillman Kolb, Jacob Kolb, John Cattell, John Mixon, John Singleton, and Abraham Colson.  Muddy Creek, in the southern part of Marlboro County, flows into the Pee Dee River at a point about two miles above  "Causeway, Cashway or Cashew, Neck" in Marlboro County and opposite "Kolb's, or Culp's, Neck" in Darlington County, as shown on a map included in a "History of Marlboro County, S.C.")

	Shortly before 1735 Henry Fox 3rd petitioned the Council of Colonial South Carolina for a grant of land situatednear to the lands then occupied by himself.  Some of the council records for this period became damaged by water or other mishaps and this writer could not locate the said petition; however, a record of the survey and grant of the land was found.  The land, also being in Marlboro County, was situated on Pee Dee River; and on the opposite side of that river, in Darlington County, were the lands of Bartholomew Ball and Thomas Haywood. - Pursuant to an order from the Surveyor General for the Province of South Carolina, on 16 January 1735 a plantation of 650 acres was laid out for Henry Fox, the said planttion being situated "in Craven County and Parish of Prince George, Winyah, bounded northeast by Mr. Hume's, southeast by Thomas Grooms', other sides  vacant".  The survey was certified on 21 September 1736 and the grant to "Colonel Henry Fox" was signed on 17 December 1737. - (Plat Book 2, p. 276; Grant Book 3, p. 117; Council Journal of South Carolina, entry of 17
December 1737.) - - - On 27 April 1756 Henry Fox of Wateree in Craven County deeded to Henry Kolb the foresaid 650 acres "in the Welsh Tract on Pee Dee River, adjoining Humses  Thomas Grooms, and vacant lands, granted to Henry Fox on 17 December 1737 in the Parish of Prince George, Winyah", the witnesses being George King and Evan Cavis. - Charleston Deeds: - Book SS, p. 13; Microfilm copy of said deed book in State Archives, Columbia, S. C . )

	Land in the Province of South Carolina was granted to qualified persons on the basis of the number of members including slaves) in their families.  Prior to 1756 a tract of 50 acres was allowed for each member in a family.  Beginning in 1756 a tract of 100 acres was allowed for the head of a family and 50 acres for each other member.  In his petition for the land the prospective grantee specified the number of family members on which his petition was based.  Though the petition of Henry Fox 3rd for the fore-mentioned 650 acres of land has not been found, from the number of acres involved it is known that the grant was based on his claim of 13 persons included in his family and for whom no land previously had been granted. Some of his later petitions were based on a stated number of children while others were based on a stated number of persons.  It apparently was his practice, after coming to South Carolina, to acquire land in different parts of the province and to place slaves (brought in from elsewhere) upon

 48



those lands; therefore, it is probable that most (if not all) of the forementioned 13 persons were slaves to be placed upon the said 650 acres of land.  It doubtless was because of such practice that H. T. Cook, author of "Rambles In The Pee Dee Basin of South Carolina", classified Henry Fox 3rd as a "landgrabber".  Due to the loss, destruction, or mutilation of many colonial records, the total number of acres of land acquired by him in the Province of South Carolina has not been determined by this writer.

	Probably at about the year 1738 Henry FGX 3rd acquired a 400- acre tract of land which was situated "about 40 miles distant" from the junction of Colonel's Creek (in the present Richland County, S.C.) and the Wateree River.  This writer has found no record of a grant or deed to him for the said land, but it apparently was situated in Prince Frederick Parish, Winyah, near the confluence of the Pocataligo and Black Rivers, either in the present Clarendon County or Williamsburg County.  He evidentaly was living there at the time of his second marriage (in 1738) and at the time of the baptism of one of his daughters (in 1742), both of which events doubtless took place in the earlier mentioned parish church which was located some miles down stream on the Black River.  In 1753 he proposed to present the said 400-acre tract, as a much better cattle range, to one Charles Linsey in exchange for a 300-acre tract just below the forementionedm junction of Colonel's Creek and Wateree River. - (R. L. Meriwether - The Expansion of Upper South Carolina, p. 107.)

	Desiring to establish a summer residence in a more salubrious climate, and being attracted by the fertile lands along the west side of the lower course of the Wateree River, at some time between 6 June 1749 and 31 December 1753 Henry Fox 3rd purchased a 200-acre tract of land (on Wateree River) which on the earlier date had been laid out for one John Gray.  On 31 December 1753 he petitioned the Council of Colonial South Carolina for a grant to confirm his title to the land. - "The petition of Henry Fox shows that he has been a resident in the Province upwards of 20 years and has 4 persons in his family for whom as yet not any land has been assigned him.  He prays for 200 acres of land on Wateree River (but which has been laid out for one John Gray and purchased by the said petitioner."  The petition was read and approved on 1 January 1754.  On the following day the Surveyor General for the Province of South Carolina ordered the District Surveyor to make a plat of the land and certify it for Henry Fox, the certification being made on 18 February 1754.  The grant for this land, signed by the Governor on 3 September 1754, recites the following: - "To Henry Fox 200 acres in Craven County on the South side of the Wateree River, bounded N.W. on land laid out to John Gendron, Esq., N.E. by the said River, and other Sides by vacant lands." - (Council Journal of South Carolina, entries of 1 January 1754 and 3 September 1754; Plat Book    , p.     ; Grant Book 6, p. 66.) - - - On 11 September 1754 Henry Fox of Craven County deeded to Edward Kirkland the aforesaid 200 acres "adjoining John Gendron,  N.E. on Wateree River, and vacant landsll, the witnesses being Henrv Dangworth, Henry Warefield, and William Harrison.  The disposition of this land by Henrv Fox evidently was occasioned by his failure to acquire the 300-acre tract mentioned in the next succeeding paragraph. - (Records at State Archives, Columbia, S.C.  - Microfilm of Charleston Deeds - Book PP, p. 504.)


49

	In 1749 a 300-acre tract of land situated on the west side of Wateree River was surveyed for one Charles Linsey who delayed completion of title for several years.  The said tract lay a short distance below the 200-acre tract described in the preceding paragraph, and on 31 October 1753 Henry Fox 3rd petitioned the Council of Colonial South Carolina that the 300 acres be granted to him. - "The petition of Henry Fox shows that he has 6 persons in his family for whom as yet not any land has been assigned him. He prays for 300 acres of land on Wateree River, formerly run out in favor of one Charles Linsey in 1749 but not yet called for though publicly advertised."  The petition was read on 1 January 1754 and it was ordered that Linsey come before the Board and show why Fox should not have the said land.  4 hearing on the matter was held during the following month, but Fox was unable to attend.  A letter from "Coll Henry Fox",dated 1 February 1754, was read on 5 February 1754.  Among the things mentioned in the letter Colonel Fox stated that: - his chief purpose in petitioning for the land was to remove as a neighbor one whose principles were "Enfatuated by the Common Enemy to Mankind"; in lieu of this land he proposed to present Linsey with 400 acres about 40 miles distant, which would make a uch better range; in the spring llit was the Lord's will to lay his correcting hand on me which rendered me incapable to take the Journey" to attend the hearing; and he prayed that "by my sons waiting on you and defraying the Expensbe which shall accrue a Warrant may be had without further trouble to that Honble Board". The letter was signed: - Henry Fox.  At the hearing Linsey vigorously denied all charges of actual wrongdoing, and was permitted to keep the land on which he previously had built his house near the river.  (Council Journal of South Carolina, entries of 1 Jan. 1754 and 5 Feb. 1754; R. L. Meriwether - The Expansion of Upper South Carolina, pp. 101 & 107)

	Following his failure to acquire the land which had been surveyed for Charles Linsey in 1749, on 5 August 1755 Henry Fox 3rd petitioned the Council of Colonial South Carolina for the grant of a tract of similar size elsewhere, - "The petition of Henry Fox shows that he has 6 children for whom he never had any warrant or grant of land.  He prays for 300 acres of land on or near Santee River or the waters thereof."  The petition was read and approved on the same day as presented.  (Council Journal of South Carolina, entry of 5 August 1755) - - - This writer has found no record of a survey or grant to Henry Fox for this land; however, since on 27 April 1756 (when the 650 acres in the Welsh Tract on Pee Dee River were sold) he as "of Wateree in Craven County", it appears that the said land had been granted to him before that date.  The 300-acre tract probably was the "Fox's old place" mentioned in a grant made to Richard S(h)ingleton on 27 January 1767.  The land granted to S(h)ingleton bounded "on the road to McCord's Ferry, the path to Fox's old place, the path to Griffin, and the road to Pine Tree Hill". - (E. L. Greene - History of Richland County, S.C., p. 79).In 1767 Henry Fox 3rd maintained his summer residence on a lOO-acre tract of land on Second Creek. (Colonel's Creek).

	A book of Memorials, Vol. 7, p. 272, in the State Archives at Columbia, S.C., shows an entry -- "Henry Fox, 700 acres in Berkley County, bounding all sides on vacant lands.  Granted 3 September 1754 to Richard Singleton and conveyed 3 May 1758 to the memorialist (Henry Fox)."  The entry was made in the memorial book on 11 January 1760.  The 700 acres apparently were situated within that triangular area of the present

50



Orangeburg County which lies north of North Edisto River and west of the towns of Woodford and North.  "The property of Benjamin Singelton",listed in the 1790 census for Orangeburg District (North Part), was situated within or adjoining the same area.  This Benjamin Singelton doubtless was the person of that name who, as shown in the 1790 census, then lived in Georgetown District (Prince George's Parish).  One Richard Sinqelton also then lived in Georgetown District, and he (or his father of the same name?) probably was the Richard Singleton who sold the 700 acres of land to Henry Fox 3rd before or after moving to Georgetown District.  It evidently was on this land that Thomas Fox, a son of Henry Fox 3rd, later established his home.

	On 4 December 1764 Henry Fox 3rd petitioned the Council of Colonial South Carolina for a grant of land. - "The petition of Henry Fox for 100 acres of land between the Congaree and Wateree Rivers was read and approved on the same day as presented."  On the same day the Deputy Surveyor General of the Province of South Carolina ordered the District Surveyor to "lay out unto Henry Fox a plantation of 100 acres situate in the fork of Santee and Wateree Rivers on a branch called Second Creek, bounded S.E. by John Griffin and other sides vacant".  The survey was certified on 11 December 1764 and the grant to Henry Fox was signed on 16 July 1765.   (Council Journal of South Carolina, entries of 4 December 1764 and 16 July 1765;
Plat Book 7, p. 445; Grant Book 12, p. 492; Memorials, Vol. 6, p. 534)  The vacant lands adjoining or near to the tract acquired by Henry Fox were subsequently surveyed for other persons: - Andrew Lester and John Allison (on 21 September 1768), Isaac Hill (on 4 February 1770), and Absolom Griffin (on 8 September 1770).  Henry Fox established a plantation home on Second Creek (the second creek above the confluence of the Congaree and Wateree Rivers), which stream became known as Colonel's Creek in deference to the title of Henry Fox 3rd.  The location of this home apparently was near the mouth of the said creek and a short distance above the present National Highway No. 378.  (E. L. Greene - History of Richland County, S.C., pp. 68 and 73; R. L. Meriwether - The Expansion of Upper South Carolina, p. 102)

	During the year 1746 Henry Fox moved from his lands on or near the Black River to or near Charleston.  A family tradition, which parallels the documental proof in this connection, recites that he came from Virginia and (eventually) settled near Charleston.  This tradition is mentioned in a letter written, on 6 June 1902, by Mrs. Priscilla Virginia Fox Starr (b. in 1836) who states that it was recited to her by her grandfather William Fox (b. in 1791) as handed down to him.  It is said that after moving to or near Charleston he would visit his several plantations from time to time; and that generally during the months of April through September, in order to escape the heat of the low country, he and/or his family lived on one of his plantations "at Wateree" in the present Richland County. On one occasion it was necessary for him to visit the Wateree plantation to settle some dissatisfaction which arose among his negroes there.  It is not known whether Henry Fox 3rd died in or near Charleston or on his plantation "at Wateree".  So far as has been determined, all of his known children who reached the age of maturity first settled in the present Richland County or in adioinina territory.

	The military career of Henry Fox 3rd as "Colonel" in South Carolina evidently was the continuation of a previous career as "Colonel" in Brunswick County, Va.  Some of the highlights of his military career in South Carolina, as mentioned in records known to this writer, were the following:

(a)  In 1736 a family of settlers near Pinetree (later called Fredericksburg and now the present town of Camden) was killed by some marauding Catawba Indians, who afterwards engaged in a series of depredations against "the Frontier Inhabitants of Craven County". The worsening situation led the said inhabitants to petition the authorities in Charleston for assistance against their foes.  At a meeting of the Commons House of Assembly, on 25 February 1737-8, a report on the petition was read (the required three times) and was wholly agreed to.  It was resolved that Colonel Henry Fox, with a guard of 5 men to be joined by 6 rangers, should go to the Catawbas and "put in Execution the several matters proposed by the said Report".  For  this mission Colonel Fox was allowed "L3 current money per Diem from the Time that he shall get his instructions till the Day of his Return to Charles Town"; and the 11 men accompanying him were allowed "a Sum not exceeding L12 per month apiece for all their Charges, Pay and Expense during the Time they are in actual Service".  The instructions to Colonel Fox were prepared and delivered to him.  After reading them Colonel Fox submitted to the Governor "some observations which he thought would not be improper to be added to his instructions".  The observations were read, considered, and agreed to by the House on 2 March 1737-8, their closing statement being: - "As to the last part of the said observations this House are of the opinion that as Colonel Fox is in the Commission of the Peace for Craven County and as that county extends, as we apprehend, to the north bounds of this Province it includes the Catawbas.  Consequently that Gentleman is empowered to act as a Magistrate anyhere within that County." - (Colonel Fox evidently then lived on his plantation near the confluence of the Pocotaligo and Black Rivers and he apparently had raised a question as to whether his authority as a magistrate - or Justice of the Peace - could be extended to cover the regions about the Catawba and Wateree Rivers.) - On 9 March 1737-8 the House adopted a resolution: - "That  the Moneys for defraying the charge of Colonel Fox's going to the Catawbas and the 5 men to go with him, as well as those (6 men) to range to the Northward till his return - - - shall be taken out of the £35010 orders and the Commissary General shall have power to draw on  the Public Treasurer for the same."  At a later date "A letter from Colonel Fox, dated 23 October 1738, was read" in the House.  In the absence of further information this writer assumes that the content of the said letter related to Colonel Fox's mission to the Catawba Indians. - (Journal of the Commons House of Assembly, 1736-1739, entries on dates indicated - or on pp. 481-483, 485, 487, 488, 494-497, 529, 533, 534, etc.; R. L. Meriwether - The Expansion of Upper South Carolina, p. 99)

52

(b)  In 1739 England declared war against Spain and General James Edward Oglethorpe, of Georgia, embraced this opportunity to send an expedition against Florida (then a Spanish possession).  After taking two towns in that colony he withdrew.  A few months later (in 1740) he again invaded Florida, and besieged St. Augustine, but the fortifications there were too strong for him.  (Eggleston - New Century History of the United States, p. 104)  At this time Spain claimed all of South Carolina and Georgia (English colonies) as a part of Florida, and had stirred up the Indians who occupied the region to make war on the English settlements.  The purpose of Oglethorpe's invasions was to punish the Spaniards and to deter them in their efforts to destroy the Georgia colony.  South Carolina assisted in the 1740 invasion by sending a military expedition against St. Augustine.  Colonel Henry Fox served in the said expedition - (L. Andrea - South Carolina Colonial Soldiers and Patriots, p. 15).

(c)  Towards the middle of e 1700's settlers began to occupy the fertile lands on the west side of the Wateree River, in a strip of territory extending northward from the confluence of that river with the Congaree River.  Soon thereafter the lower section of the said strip was designated as "Wateree Township".  This land area was claimed by the Wateree Indians, they being settled below the Catawba Indians who claimed the lands further north.  In 1740 the Waterees objected to the settlement on their lands and launched a course of "flagrant and insolent  Behaviour", with a demand for satisfaction.  The threatening situation became known to Colonel Henry Fox, who addressed a letter to the Governor advising him of the matter.  On 20 August 1740 the Governor sent the letter to the Commons House of Assembly with the message: - "I herewith send a Letter just received from Colonel Fox acquainting me with the uneasiness of the Wateree Indians, who claim the lands in and about the Wateree Township and insist upon Satisfaction, as appears by the said Letter."  Subsequently Colonel Fox was sent, with the command of 6  rangers provided, to bring the Indians to terms.  However, neither the threat to send a formidable force of soldiers against them or to bring the Seneca Indians upon them availedi and they were not quieted until some of the head men later were invited to Charleston for a conference. (R. L. Meriwether - The Expansion of Upper South Carolina, p. 100; Journals of the Commons House of Assembly, 1739-1741, entries on 20 August 1740 and 20 November 1740, or pp.     and 410.)

(Colonel Joseph Fox)

	This writer once thought that Henry Fox 3rd was the "Colonel Fox" who, during the period of 1736-1741, was dispatched to the Cherokee Nation for the purpose of arresting Christian Priber the Secretary of State for that nation.  From the colonial records of South Carolina (Journal of the CommonsHouse of Assembly, 1736-1739, pp. 662-663; Ibid, 1739-1741, pp. 60 and 111.) it later was learned that the said "Colonel Fox" was one Colonel Joseph Fox.  He was not of the family of Henry Fox 3rd, but probably was a son or grandson of the Stephen Fox who came as an immigrant to South Carolina from The Barbadoes in 1679.  More particulars of the events with which Colonel Joseph Fox was associated are set forth in Logan's "History of Upper South Carolina", Vol. 1, pp. 302-4, 403 and 452, and in the South Carolina
Historical and Genealogical Magazine, Vol. 10 (1909), p. 60.  He probably was the Joseph Fox who was a Justice of the Peace for Berkley County, S.C., in 1734.  (See the South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine, Vol . 1 1, p . 1 88 . )
53

(d)  As mentioned earlier, Henry Fox moved to or near Charleston before 1746.  He then became attached to the War Office in Charleston, and record is faund that both on 1 July 1746 and on 25 June 1747 he signed the commissions and appointments of certain officers to duty in the three independent companies of troops in South Carolina.  It is found that fifteen years later he then was attached to the War Office as "Paymaster General".  A Cherokee War document, dated 30 July 1761, was addressed - "To our right trusty and well beloved Councillor Henry Fox, Esqr., Paymaster General of Our Guards Garrison and Land Forces." (South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine, Vol. 1, p. 152 and Vol. 33, pp. 291 and 292)

	It is learned that Henry Fox 3rd also was a participant in the civic affairs of the county and parish in which he owned land and maintained a residence.  He is mentioned in 1737 and 1738 (by title of "Colonel Fox") as being a Justice of the Peace for Craven County.  (Journal of the Commons House of Assembly, 1736-1739, p.   ; South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine, Vol. 11, p. 189) - - - In 1740 and in 1742 he was appointed as a member of the Petit Jury for Prince Frederick Parish,Winyah.  The printed copy of the herein cited reference, contains a note stating "Original appointment 20 August 1731".  This, however, is evidently a mis- print and probably should be 20 August 1734 (or later) since Prince Frederick Parish, Winyah, was not formed until the year 1734.  (Laws of South Carolina - Acts of the Legislature, 1740 and 1742.) - - - In 1740 (?) the inhabitants of the upper part of Prince Frederick Parish petitioned that Henry Fox, Esqr., Mr. James Singleton, Mr. Richard Singleton, and Mr. James McGirt be authorized as Commissioners to order the "laying out and clearing a Road from the Wateree Township, otherwise called Fredericks Burgh, the most convenient way to Richmond's Bluff, otherwise called Hearn's Bluff". -(Journal of the Commons House of Assembly, 1739-1741, p. 505.)  This road probably was part of "the most convenient way" from the present Camden, S.C., to the parish church on Black River.  Henry Fox and James McGirt (both mentioned in the Register Book of Prince Frederick Parish, Winyah) then lived within the region about the parish church, while James Singleton and Richard Singleton apparently then lived in Wateree Township. - - - On 8 May 1754 the Commons House of Assembly read the petition of the inhabitants of Frederick Township "who reside at or near the road leading from the Catawba to the Congarees, for a road from the upper inhabitants of Wateree River down to Joiner Ferry and from thence the most convenient way to the main road to Charleston, with establishment of a ferry across the river at the plantation of Anthony Wright".  Henry Fox, being then a landowner and a part-time resident among the inhabitants along the west side of Wateree River, was a signer of the said petition.  (Journal of the Commons House of Assembly, 17  -17  , p.

	When Henry Fox moved to or near Charleston, as mentioned earlier, he sold 20 horses from his lands on or near the Black River.  The bill of sale for the horses, signed by him on 6 March 1745-6, is recorded on page 407 of a book entitled "Miscellaneous Records, 1736-1740", deposited in the Office of the Probate Judge at Charleston Courthouse.  This record recites: - "Henry Fox of Prince Frederick Parish, Craven County, for L1000 paid to him by James Maxwell of St. John's Parish, Berkley County,sells to the said James Maxwell 20 horses branded - two FF, five JF, ten F, one MF, one VC, one R7".  The letter "F" appearing in most of these brand marks apparently indicated "Fox" as the original owner of the horses so branded.

54


	On page 63 of H. T. Cook's "Rambles In The Pee Dee Basin Of South Carolina" it is stated that "Colonel Fox was an eminent lawyer in CharlesTown".  No record has been found to show when and where he qualified for the practice of law.  In the previously mentioned Cherokee War Document of 30 July 1761 he is named as "our right trusty and well beloved Councillor (obsolete spelling of counsellor) Henry Fox, Esqr.", which indicates that he then practiced law and also performed the duty of "Paymaster General of Our Guards Garrisons and Land Forces".


	Henry Fox 3rd was twice married.  As hereto mentioned, it is thought that his first wife (Mary) was a Miss Goodwyn (perhaps the daughter of Jesse Goodwyn of Dinwiddie County, Va., whose son John Goodwyn died about 1776 in the present Richland County, S.C.).  Common use of the names "Thomas;, "Temperance", and "Jesse" in the Goodwyn family and the family of this Henry Fox, together with recorded business relations between these two families in South Carolina, suggest that an intermarriage occurred.  The first wife died about 1736/7 (?).  On 20 August 1738 he married his second wife, Mrs. Martha Keen (widow), this marriage being recorded in the Register Book of Prince Frederick Parish, Winyah, S.C.  The total number of his children has not been determined; however, the names of seven of them are known from various records.  Of the following mentioned ones the first four were children of the first wife and the others were children of the second wife.

a.  Unity (b. ca. 1724; lvg. 1778). - She married, about 1743, Claudius Richbourg (b. ca. 1718; d. 1788) of old Camden District, S.C.  Her third son, John Richbourg (b. 1747; d. 1838), served in the Revolutionary War with his uncle Lieutenant Joseph Fox. -(Richbourg Family Records; Pension Application of John Richbourg, File S. 18175, in National Archives at Washington, D.C.)

 b.  Thomas (b. 1725; d. 16 Nov. 1822). - (See ChaPter 5.)

c.  Henry (b. ca. 1727; lvg. 175g-60) - On 2 January 1754 the  petition of Henry Fox, Jr., and (his brother) John Fox for 100 acres of land, between the Wateree River and the Congaree River, was read and approved - (Council Journal of South Carolina, entry of 2 January 1754). No record of a survey or grant for the land has been found by this writer. - - - Henry Fox served as a member of Captain John Canty's Company, under Colonel Richard Richardson, during the Cherokee Indian War of 1759-1760.  He was listed as No. 32 on a muster roll of Captain Canty's Company, whose men were mainly from Camden District of Craven County. (L. Andrea - South Carolina Colonial Soldiers and Patriots, p. 15; Muster and Pay Roll of Men in the Cherokee Expedition, in the State Archives at Columbia, S.C.) - - - This writer knows nothing further concerning this Henry Fox.  He might have died during the Cherokee Indian War.


55


d.  John (b. ca. 1729; d. 1781) - As mentioned earlier, on 2 January 1754 he and (his brother) Henry Fox, Jr., petitioned for a grant of 100 acres of land situated between the Wateree River and the Congaree River.  On 5 May 1772 his petition was read and approved for the grant of 200 acres of land in South Carolina.  (Council Journal of South Carolina, entries of 2 January 1754 and 5 May 1772) No record of a survey or grant for either tract of land has been found by this writer. - - - John Fox served as a soldier under Colonel _____ Singleton during the Cherokee Indian War of 1759-1760.  Colonel Singleton's men were mainly from Granville and Colleton Counties plus some from western Berkley County.  John Fox was from western Berkley County, and is listed on a muster roll as "deserted on 6 December".  It is stated that "Many of these men listed as deserters were evidently lost in the mountains".  (L. Andrea - South Carolina Soldiers and Patriots, pp. 5 and 15; Muster and Pay Roll of Men in the Cherokee Expedition, in the State Archives at Columbia, S.C.)  He probably was living at or near Charleston, in the southwestern part of the then Berkley County, when he joined the Cherokee Expedition. - - - During the Revolutionary War John Fox served as a private (on horse-back in Captain Andrew Miller's Company, under Colonel_______ Anderson and appears on the pay roll of that company for February 1779 through May 1780.  On 7 December 1781 he was captured at Pratt's Mill on Long Cane Creek by Hezekiah Williams, a Tory leader, and carried to the Cherokee Nation where he was killed.  His widow received payment of the amount due him for service and for articles which were lost at Pratt's Mill.  (Revolutionary War Records in State Archives at Columbia, S.C.; A. S. Salley - Stub Indents for Revolutionary Claims in South Carolina, Book I, p. 71; Revolutionary Claims Filed in South Carolina, John Fox - Returns Nos. 28 and 121; Spirit of Patriotism - Revolutionary and Ancestral Records - SAR California, p. 367) - - - He married, about 1765, Mary______(d. in 1828) who perhaps was a Miss Black.  She is listed, as the head of a family, in the 1790 through 1820 censuses of Abbeville County, S.C., this being the locality in which she and her husband settled before or about 1766.  Her will (19 February 1828-18 November 1828) mentions her son Matthew Fox and daughters - Elizabeth Fox, Catherine Fox, Mary Ann Lucrecy Posten (mother of Mary Posten), and Elenor Able (wife of James Able).  The executors of her will were Joseph Black and James A. Black. (Abbeville County Records - Will Book 2, 1815-1839, p. 197; File Box 107, Pack. 2809) - - - The daughter Elizabeth died unmarried, leaving a will which was proved on 1 March 1845.  (Will Book 3, 1839 - 1855, p. 150; File Box 36, Pack. 784). - - - The son Matthew Fox was born in 1766, "in Abbeville District, S.C."; and he enlisted there, in 1781, as  a soldier in the Revolutionary War.  On 31 July 1797 a plat for 500 acres of land in Abbeville District was certified for him.  He later moved to Newport, Cocke County, Tenn., where he was living when he applied for a revolutionary war pension.  (Pension Application of Matthew Fox, File R.3729, in the National Archives at Washington, D.C.;Index to Plats, Bundle 63 - Plat 171, in the State Archives at Columbia, S.C.)


56


e.  Temperance (b. 19 March 1741; d.    ) - On 17 June 1742 Temperance Fox, daughter of Henry and Martha Fox, was baptized. (Register Book of Prince Frederick Parish, Winyah, S.C.)

f.  William (b. ca. 1743? d. 1816) - On 4 April 1769 William Fox petitioned the Council of South Carolina to certify to him a plat for 100 acres of land (previously surveyed for Oliver Jackson on 11 March 1767) in Craven County, in the fork of the Congaree and Wateree Rivers, bounding all sides on vacant lands.  The plat was certified on the same day and the grant to William Fox was signed on 27 September 1769. The record of this land was recorded in a book of Memcrials on 14 November 1769. (Council Journal of South Carolina, entries of 4 April 1769 and 27 September 1769; Memorials, Vol. 8, page 536; E. L. Greene - History of Richland County, S.C., p. 68) - - - On 4 September 1770 a plat was certified for him for 100 acres of land (previously surveyed for Edward Carroll on 24 April 1767) in Craven County between the Wateree and Congaree Rivers, bounding all sides on Vacant lands.  The grant to William Fox was signed on 3 November 1770. The record of this land was recorded in a book of Memorials on  3 January 1771. (Memorials, Vol. 10, p. 297; E. L. Greene - History of Richland County, S.C., p. 72) - - - At some time prior to or during1775 William Fox was granted 250 acres of land in Craven County in the fork of the Wateree and Congaree Rivers.  On 1 May 1775 he (William Fox of Camden District) sold 100 acres of this tract to Captain John Russell.  (Records at Charleston Courthouse; - Deed Book S-4, p. 209; Microfilm of said deed book in State Archives at Columbia, S.C.) - - - On 26 June 1784 a plat was certified for him for 640 acres of land in 96 District, on Great Generosity Creek (a tributary of Savannah River, in the present Anderson and Abbeville Counties, adjoining lands laid out to other persons.  The grant to William Fox was signed on 16 July 1784. (Index to Plats: - Bundle 63, Plat No. 176; Grant Book    , p.    ) - - - On 22 March 1785 a plat was certified for him for 640 acres of land in Camden District, on the north side of Congaree River.  The grant to William Fox was signed on 5 September 1785. (Index to Plats: - Bundle 63; Plat No. 177; Grant Book    , p.    ) - - - During the Revolutionary War William Fox served as horseman, cattle-driver, and assistant to the Quartermaster.  In 1781 he served 30 days "at Ancrum's" under Captain John Cook; in 1782 he served 183 days at McCord's Ferry under Captain John McCord and 33 days at Orangeburg under Captain Willis Whitaker.  He was one of General Marion's Men (being on "A List of Twenty-five Hundred"), and family tradition holds that he fought at the battles of King's Mountain and Cowpens.  On 13 August 1782 he requested that any indent made out in his name for military service be delivered to Mr. David McCord.  An indent was issued to him for 246 days' militia duty in 1781-1782. (Revolutionary War Records in State Archives at Columbia, S.C.; A. S. Salley - Stub Indents for Revolutionary Claims in South Carolina, Book W, p. 280; Revolutionary Claims filed in South Carolina, William Fox - Return No. 62: Spirit of Patriotism - Revolutionary and Ancestral Records - SAR California, p. 367; E. L. Greene - History of Richland County, S.C., p. 94) - - - He married, about 1766, Sarah Carroll (d. before 13 April 1808 - not mentioned in his will ) and settled in the present Richland .C.. and is listed in the 1790 throuqh 1810 federal censuses


57

for that county. - - - (The 1790 Census Act required that "The enumeration shall commence on the first Monday in August next, and shall close within nine calendar months thereafter".  It became necessary to extend the nine-month period, and the enumeration in South Carolina was not completed until February 1792; therefore, it is probable that the 1790 listing for William Fox actually shows the membership of his family in 1791 or early 1792.  This is clearly evident in the case of his son Henry Fox whose first child was born on 6 March 1791, whereas the 1790 census listing for Henry Fox shows that he then had one male under 16 years of age as a member of his family.) - - - The will of William Fox, dated 13 April 1808 and proved 1 July 1816, names seven children while the 1790 census indicates that there perhaps was another son (William Jr.?, under 16 years of age) who died prior to 13 April 1808.  The said seven children are named in the following order but, based on a study of available census records and the known dates of birth for four of them, it is evident that they are not named in the order of birth: - Henry (b. 12 June 1768; d. 18 January 1852; md. Sarah Harrell; had issue, - 13 children); Ann Scott (b. ca. 1767?; d. before 13 April 1808; probably the second wife of William Scott whose estate was administered in 1796 by Mrs. Ann Scott and George Scott who perhaps was her stepson; left a number of surviving children); Unity Carter (b. 20 October 1781; d. 16January 1870; was the wife of Robert Carter; had issue, - 10 children), Mary Powell (b. ca. 1772?; lvg. 13 April 1808; was the wife of Powell; had issue     ?), Elizabeth Killingsworth (b. ca. 1770?; d. before 13 April 1808; was the lst? wife of Jesse? Killingsworth; left two surviving children),     Elijah (b. 16 May 1789; twin; d. 23 April 1863; unmarried?), and Elisha (b. 16 May 1789; twini d. 17 February 1862; unmarried?).  (Fox Family Records; Richland County, S.C., Records: - Will Book "G", p. 3 - File Box 10, Pack. 245.)

9.  Joseph (b. ca. 1745; lvg. 1783 but probably died before 1790) - On 25 June 1775 Joseph Fox (aged 30 years, born in South Carolina, 6 feet tall) was commissioned as Sergeant in Captain Richardson's Company in the 7th Regiment of Rangers commanded by Colonel William Thompson. On 7 August 1775 the company was in camp "at the Mineral Spring near the Congarees".  He appears on the roll of Colonel Thompson's Rangers (Captain Richardson's Company) during the period of June 1775 - November 1775.  (South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine, Vol. 1, p. 121; Ibid, Vol. 2, p. 181; Ibid, Vol. 3, p. 69) - - - On 7 May 1776 he enlisted, as Seryeant, in the 6th South Carolina Regiment of Continental Troops and was discharged therefrom on 1 June 1777.  In 1781, as Lieutenant Fox he was wounded in the battle of Quinby Bridge in South Carolina.  A "revolutionary claim" was filed by him at some time between 20 August 1783 and 31 August 1786.  (Revolutionary War Records in the National Archives at Washington, D.C.; Pension Application, File S. 18175, of John Richbourg in the National Archives at Washington, D.C.; S. S. Ervin - South Carolinians in the Revolution, p. 69; Revolutionary claims filed in South Carolina, Joseph Fox - Return No. 5) This writer knows nothing further of him.


58


	It appears to be certain that Henry Fox 3rd (Colonel) died at some time between 4 February 1770 and 8 September 1770.  Lands granted to one Isaac Hill on the former date were described as being bounded "by the lands of Henry Fox", while lands granted to one Absalom Griffith on the latter date were described as being bounded "by lands of the estate of Henry Fox".  (E. L. Greene - History of Richland County, S.C., p. 68)  As yet, no will nor administration of his estate has been found.

CHAPTER 5


THOMAS FOX


	Thomas Fox (b. 1725; d. 16 November 1822) evidently was born in Brunswick County, Va.  He came to South Carolina with his parents and lived with his father, successively, in those parts of the province which now are Marlboro County, Clarendon or Williamsburg County (on or near the Black River), and in or near the city of Charleston.

	On 16 October 1751 Thomas Fox sold to James Myrick "a bay horse branded on the near buttocks with three dots (:-)", the witness being Jethro Marming (?).  On 22 January 1753, in Berkley County, S.C., the witness appeared before a legal officer and gave testimony concerning the bill of sale. - (Miscellaneous Records, Vol. 80B, 1751-1754, p. 543, in the office of the Probate Judge at Charleston Courthouse.)  It appears that at the time of this sale Thomas Fox was living in Berkley County (in or near Charleston) while James Myrick then lived in the western part of the present Williamsburg County.

	Thomas Fox served as a soldier under Colonel________ Singleton during the early part of the Cherokee Indian War of 1759-176.  Colonel Singleton's men were mainly from Granville and Colleton Counties plus some from western Berkley County.  Thomas Fox was from western Berkley County, and is listed on a muster roll as "deserted on 10 December".  It is stated that "Many of those men listed as deserters were evidently lost in the mountains".  He doubtless was one of the lost men; and, being unable to find his command, he went to his father's plantation home in the present Richland County (earlier a part of the Camden District of Craven County), and there continued his service in the Cherokee Expedition as a member of Captain John Canty's Company under Colonel Richard Richardson.  He was listed as No. 35 on a muster roll of Captain Canty's Company, whose men were mainly from Camden District of Craven County. - (L. Andrea - South Carolina Colonial Soldiers and Patriots, p. 15; Muster and Pay Roll of Men in the Cherokee Expedition, in the State Archives at Columbia, S.C.)  The forementioned James Myrick (from the western area of Williamsburg County) at
the same time also served under Colonel Richard Richardson.  Prior to 1790 James Myrick settled in the south part of old Orangeburg District and was living there when the census for that year was taken.

	In the return of the appraised property of Jesse Goodwyn (son of John Goodwyn from Dinwiddie County, Va.) who died in 1767 in the present Richland County (earlier a part of the Camden District of Craven County), S.C., is a list of persons from whom he held notes and bonds.  Thomas Fox was one of the persons so listed. - (E. L. Greene - History of Richland County, S.C.; Inventory Book Y, 1769, pp. 5-7.); and, from this document, it is inferred that he settled in Richland County and lived there during a number of years following his service in the Cherokee Expedition.

	Apparently at the time of his father's death in 1770 Thomas Fox became possessed of the 700-acre tract of land which Henry Fox 3rd owned in that part of Berkeley County which now is Orangeburg County.  He settled on that place and, with the exception of a few years, lived there during the remainder of his life. - - - On 24 October 1784 two plats, each for 100 acres, were certified for him for land situated on Chinquapin Creek (waters of North Edisto River) in that part of Orangeburg District which now is Lexington County.  The two grants for this land were signed on 5 June 1786. - (Index to Plats: - Bundle 63, Plats No. 172 and 173; Grant Book lOs p. 160; Grant Book 11, p. 131.) - - - On 21 January 1787 a plat for 390 acres was certified for him for land situated on a fork of Chinquapin Creek (waters of North Edisto River) in that part of Orangeburg District which now is Lexington County.  The name of the said fork was Lightwood Knot Creek, and the said land was located "a mile or so" from its junction with Chinquapin Creek.  The grant for the 390 acres was signed on 5 March 1787.  (Index to Plats: -Bundle 63, Plat 174; Grant Book 18, p. 79.) - - - Most of the public records of Orangeburg and Lexington Counties were destroyed during the War Between the States, and the disposition of the forementioned lands cannot now be determined.  However, it is known that a 150-acre tract (part of the 390-acre tract) descended to one of the sons of Thomas, and it is probable that all of these lands were inherited by his children.

	On 27 November 1775, at the age of 50 years, Thomas Fox enlisted as a revolutionary soldier in the 2nd South Carolina Regiment commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (Francis) Marion.  He served continuously  in that regiment, as shown by its rolls, until his discharge on 28 November 1778. -(Revolutionary War Records in National Archives at Washington, D.C.)  Family tradition recites that during the revolution the house of Thomas Fox was burned three times by the Tories of the area in which he then lived, and he and his family took refuge in "Mike Watson's block house" near to the present town of Ridge Spring, S.C.  This move evidently occurred after his discharge from the 2nd South Carolina Regiment; and after thus assuring the protection of his family he resumed revolutionary service as a soldier in Captain Samuel Messer's Company of Militia. - (Samuel Messer was listed in the 1790 census for Edgefield County, S.C., as a resident within the area including or near to the present town of Ridge Spring.) - A letter addressed to William Hard and Benjamin Waring, Esqrs., and signed by Thomas Fox on 4 June 1792, reads - "Please to deliver to Capt. Samuel Messer or his Order Indents to the Amount of my Account Returned to the Auditor General by William Arthur, Esqr., for Eighteen days duty in Capt. Messers Company of Militia." - (Revolutionary War Records in State Archives at Columbia, S.C.)
- - - His revolutionary service has been established with the national (Washington, D.C.) and state (South Carolina) offices  of the Daughters of  the American Revolution.

	Thomas Fox is listed in the 1790 through 1820 federal censuses of South Carolina.  In 1790 he was living on one of his recently acquired tracts of land on or near Chinquapin Creek.  Due to the loss of part of the 1800 census records, his whereabouts in that year has not been determined.  The 1810 and 1820 censuses show him as a resident of Orangeburg County, after returning to his Orangeburg plantation where he probably died and was buried in 1822.


61


	The Fox family bibles owned by some of his descendants show the  date of Thomas Fox's death and his age at the time of death.  These bibles  also show that he married Elizabeth/Eliza Hancock and that she died at the age of 92 years.  She was born about 1731 and died about 1823.  They married at about 1756, probably in or near Charleston.  The total number of their children has not been determined; however, the names of the following listed ones are known from the forementioned family bibles and other records.

a.  Michael (b. ca. 1756; d.    ). - On 15 April 1776 he enlisted for revolutionary service in the 5th South Carolina Regiment, and perhaps died during the war. - (Revolutionary War records in the National Archives at Washington, D.C.)

 b.  Elijah (b. ca. 1758; lvg. 1797). - He might have had a wife and one daughter in 1790 and was then living with his parents.  In 1797 he was serving as Constable of Orangeburg District, S.C. -(Laws of South Carolina - Acts of the Legislature.)

c.  Elizabeth (b. ca. 1763; lvg. 1830). - She married Peter 0liver (b. in 1752; lvg. 1833), before 1787, who was a revolutionary soldier. - (Oliver family records; Revolutionary War records in the National Archives at Washington, D.C.; 1830 Federal Census for 0rangeburg County, S.C., p. 163.)

d.  Rachel (b. ca. 1768; d. 1806). - In 1792 she married Stephen Johns(t)on (b. 11 November 1766; d. 20 August 1836) who married Rosannah Williams, his second wife, in 1807.  Shortly before 1830 Stephenand Rosannah Johns(t)on moved to Pike County, Ala. - (Williams, Fox, and Johnston Family records; Federal Censuses: - 1790 for Orangeburg District, North Part, S.C. - 1810 and 1820 for Lexington County, S.C. - 1830 for Pike County, Ala. - The 1800 census for Lexington County, S.C., is not available.)

e.  Thomas (b. 1770; lvg. 1840). - At about 1805 he married Elizabeth Williams (d. ca. 18Q8), his first wife, who was a sister of the second wife of Stephen Johns(t)on and a daughter of Jeremiah and Nancy (Graham) Williams.  At about 1809 he married Sallie Barton (b. ca. 1784; d. ca. 1825), his second wife, who was a sister of Nancy Barton  the second wife of William Williams.  He is listed in the 1810 through 1840 federal censuses as the head of a family in Lexington County, S.C.  The names of his children, except one daughter (died young) of his first wife, are shown in various family records and in the 1850 and subsequent federal censuses.  The named children (one by the first wife and all others by the second wife) were - Rosannah (daughter of first wife; b. ca. 1808; lvg. 1840; md., before or during 1831, William Elliott, Jr.; inherited her mother's interest in the estate of her grandfather Jeremiah Williams), Rachel (b. ca. 1810; lvg. 1860; unmd.), Calvin (b. ca. 1812; lvg. 1870; md., in 1849, Emily Herron and had eight or more children), Thomas (b. ca. 1815; d. before 1830), William Henry (b. ca. 1818; d. ca. 1887; unmd.), Matilda (b. ca. 1820; lvg. 1860; unmd.), and Michael Watson (b. 5 December 1822; d. 12 January 1869; md., in 1842, Almira Herron and had twelve children). - - -  He probably


62


inherited, and lived upon, part of the lands owned by his father on or near Chinquapin Creek in Lexington County.  On 20 October 1840 a plat for 128 acres of land in Lexington County was certified for him. -(Index to Plats - Bundle 63, Plat No. 175.)  A letter written by him to his brother Jesse Fox is in possession of Mrs. Nancy Fox Wingard, one of his descendants.  The family bible of Jesse Fox mentions his father as Thomas Fox, Sr.; therefore, it is evident that the latter was also the father of Thomas Fox, Jr.  In 1932 Colonel Claude E. Sawyer of Aiken, S.C., wrote a letter to Mrs. Mary Norris of Edgefield, S.C., they being grandchildren of Jesse Fox, in which he mentioned their "Uncle Tom Fox" .

f.  Temperance/Tempie (b. ca. 1772; d.     ). - At about 1793 she married Daniel Williams who was a brother of Elizabeth Williams (first wife of Thomas Fox) and Rosannah Williams (second wife of Stephen Johnston).  He inherited an interest in the estate of his father Jeremiah Williams.  At some time between 1820 and 1831 Daniel and Temperance/Tempie Williams moved to Hall County, Ga. - (Williams and Fox Family records; Records at Anderson Courthouse, S.C. - Settlement of Estate of Captain Jeremiah Williams in 1831.)

CHAPTER 6 - SECTION 1


JESSE FOX


	Jesse Fox (b. 3 January 1774; d. 26 March 1850) was a man of sterling worth and character.  One of his friends, General Paul Quattlebaum, said of him - "He was a respectable, good old man, through the many years of my acquaintance with him."  One of his grandsons, Colonel Isaiah G. W. Steedman said of him - "He was a good and true Christian man in his old age, when I knew him.  He was stern, but just, in his ideas of right and wrong, was peculiarly quick of speech, and would not allow his grandsons to romp or make loud noises about the yard."

	Jesse Fox evidently first settled at Hollow Creek in Lexington County, in the neighborhood of John Howardls store which later became known as "John Howard's Grog Shop".  While living at that place he was a justice of the peace and a manager of elections during a number of years prior to 1822.  Being opposed to the sale and drinking of intoxicants (as recited by some of his grandchildren in later years), at about 1822 he moved from Hollow Creek to the fork of Lightwood Knot Creek and Chinquapin Creek (these creeks being the headwaters of North Edisto River) and settled on a 670-acre tract of land which he owned.  This land lay on both sides (partly
in the present Lexington County and partly in the present Aiken County) of Chinquapin Creek and his homestead and family graveyard were located on the north side (in the present Lexington County) of that creek, being a mile or so above its junction with Lightwood Knot Creek.  This location was a few miles below the present town of Batesburg, S.C., and about four miles above the Steedman's old family home (on National Highway No. 178) in Lexington County.  Jesse Fox and his wife lie buried in the family grave-yard.  After his death the 670 acres of land (except one square acre around and including the graveyard) and buildings thereon were bought by Joshua H.
Burgess who married Jesse's daughter Mary Fox.  In 1932 the property was owned by a Mr. Hallman. - (Letters of General Paul Quattlebaum, Colonel Claude E. Sawyer, Colonel Isaiah G. W. Steedman, the Reverend John Marcellus Steadman, and Mrs. Mamie N. Tillman; Edwin G. Scott - Recollections of a Long Life, pp. 109 and 110; Lexington County, S.C., Deed Book S, p. 151.)

	Due to the loss or destruction of many public records of Lexington County during the War Between the States, all of the lands which might have been owned by Jesse Fox now cannot be determined.  However, a deed book among the records which escaped loss or destruction shows that three tracts of land belonging to his estate were sold on 23 February 1853 (three years after his death) by his then living children who are named in the covering deeds.  The said tracts were:

	670 acres (sold to Joshua H. Burgess, as heretofore mentioned) situated on both sides of Chinquapin Creek and bounded by lands of William and James H. Merritt, Michael Howard, Emanuel Quattlebaum, James Eagan, Anderson Steedman, Peter Rowe, William Hall, Joseph H. Fox, and Reuben Steedman. - (Deed Book S, pp. 151, 334, and 339.)

64


150 acres (sold to Joseph H. Fox, son of Jesse Fox), known by name of William Hall Place, situated on Boggy Branch of Chinquapin Creek and bounded by lands of William and James Merritt, Michael Howard, and other persons, the said 150 acres being part of 390 acres originally granted to Thomas Fox (father of Jesse Fox). -
(Deed Book S, pp. 159 and 334.)

100 acres (sold to William A. and James H. Merritt), being the place "whereon Joshua H. Burgess now resides", situated on Chinquapin Creek and Boggy Branch and bounded on all sides by lands of  William A. and James H. Merritt. - (Deed Book S, pp. 334, 337, and 339.)

In a letter written by him under date of 6 January 1966, Mr. Lee  Gandee (then of Hickory, N.C.), a historian of Lexington County, S.C.,  states: - "Regarding the Foxes, this family was one of the great ante-bellum planting families in Lexington County.  They had many hundreds of acres of land near my place down there, and even a small tract below mine.  The most lovely pre-war house in Lexington (town) is the Fox House, and their river house was said to be much nicer still." - (The house in the town of Lexington was the home of Jesse's son John Fox and now is the Lexington County Museum.)

	In 1813 and again in 1817 Jesse Fox was appointed as a Justice of the Peace for Lexington County.  In the years 1818, 1819, and 1821, he was appointed as Manager of Election, at John Howard's Store in Lexington County, - (Laws of South Carolina - Acts of the Legislature.)

	Jesse Fox is listed in the 1810 through 1840 federal censuses ofLexington County, S.C.  He is listed twice in the 1820 census, - once for Lexington County and once for Orangeburg County.  It is believed that very soon after being listed in the Lexington County census he went to Orangeburg County to care for his aged and ailing parents and there occupied a separate house near to them.  Shortly after becoming settled in that house the inhabitants of the area were enumerated and he was among those listed in the Orangeburg County census.  It is probable that he did not return to Lexington County until 1821, in which year he was last appointed Manager of Election at John Howard's Store.  The census records show that he owned a number of slaves.  His widow (Ferabe Fox) is listed in the 1850 federal census for Lexington County.

	The Fox family bible records show that, on 17 March 1805, Jesse Fox married Faraba Ward (b. 11 December 1788; d. 17 January 1853, aged 64 years), daughter of John and Winnefred/Winny Ward, and that they were the parents of the 13 following named children.

1.  John (b. 14 December 1805; d. 1 July 1884). - For many years he was a public office-holder in or from Lexington County.  In 1826 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace; in 1828 he was appointed Sheriff, and served until 1832; and in 1836 he was again appointed Sheriff, and served until 1840. - (Laws of South Carolina, Acts of the Legislature.)  In 1840 he was elected Clerk of Court, and served until 1852;

65

in 1852 he was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives, from his county, and served until 1856; in 1856 he was elected to the South Carolina Senate, from his county, and served until 1860.  He served as a commissioner to approve securities, and as a commissioner of public buildings.  He was a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1865. - (Biographical Directory Of The Senate of South Carolina, 1776-1964, p. 218.)  During the feverish period immediately preceding the War Between the States he advocated the position that it was inexpedient for South Carolina to secede from the Union; though he held the view that, under the constitution, the state had the right to secede.  He was a candidate on the Union ticket for the Secession Convention; however, when the Secession Ordnance was passed he "went with the state and did all that he could" to support it in the War.  In after years members of his faily recited that, - "when Sherman came through Lexington County some of the Yankees hung John Fox three times to make him give up his money". - (Since he survived the war, this writer assumes that Sherman's men finally got the money.)

	On 23 February 1853 John Fox deeded to the purchasers his interest in the lands which were part of the estate of Jesse Fox, and his wife Eliza A. Fox renounced her dower rights. - (Deed Book "S", pp. 151, 159, and 337.)  As heretofore mentioned, he established his home in the town of Lexington.  He acquired the notable house recently known as the "Fox-Madden House" and lived there until the time of his death.  This house was owned and occupied by one or another of his descendants until 1969, when it was acquired by the Lexington County Historical Society for use as a museum.

	John Fox married (1), on 29 March 1827, Anna Magdalena Mathias (d. 8 November 1830; mother of Sarah Ann Fox and Joseph Ward Fox who, respectively, died 18 October 1830 and 17 November 1830).  He married (2), on 1 November 1832, Eliza Ann Poindexter (b. 28 December 1812; d. 9 November 1899) who was the mother of -

	John Fox is listed in the 1830 through 1880 federal censuses for Lexington County, S.C.  Being also a planter, he was the owner of a number of slaves and the value of his real estate holdings in 1860 was shown as $86,700.00. He was buried in the cemetery at Batesburg, S.C.

	2. Mary (b. 7 September 1807; lvg. in 1887). - At about 1833 she married Joshua Burgess (b. ca. 1800) and became the mother of (Burgess children) - Emmaline (b. 1835; md. Jasper H. Jones who died of sickness during the War Between the States), J. Hirman (b. 1837; killed in the first year of the War Between the States), Hightower Van Buren (b. 1839; killed in the first year of the War Between the States), J. Shelton
(b. 1843, md. and had issue), Felix (b. 1845; md. and had issue), and Noah G. (b. 1847; md. and had issue). - (Family Records; Federal Census Records, 1840 through 1870, for Lexington County, S.C.) -- As heretofore mentioned, on 23 February 1853 Joshua Burgess bought a 670-acre tract of land (including the homestead) which belonged to the estate of Jesse Fox.  This place was in the line of Sherman's march during the War Between the States, from which the Burgess family suffered much.  On
23 February 1853 Mary and her husband deeded to the purchasers their interest in other lands which were part of the estate of Jesse Fox. -(Deed Book "S" , pp. 151, 1 59, and 337 . )

	3. Rachel (b. 15 September 1809; d. 16 May 1825) - In 1824, at the age of 15 years, she married_______  Livingston. She left no issue.


67


	4.  Daniel Jesse (b. 4 December 1811; d. after 1865). - During 1830-1832 he boarded with a Mr. John Bates, at or near the present town of Batesburg, S.C., and taught a school. - (Life of Mahlon M. Padgett, Esq., of Trenton, Edgefield County, S.C., pp. 6 and 7) - - - After 1832 he attended and graduated from the Charleston Medical College, in Charleston, S.C., and settled in Alabama as a practising physician. He first lived at Selma, in Dallas County, and later moved to Wilcox County.  He is listed in the 1850 and 1860 federal censuses for Wilcox County, Ala., which show him to be a doctor/physician; and the latter census shows the value of his real estate holdings as $85,000.00. - - - At about 1839 he married Louisa  E. McConico (b. ca. 1820; lvg. 1860), and after her death he married a second wife.  His children by the first wife, as shown by census records, were:  Ella (b. 1840), Charles M. (b. 1843), Edward N. (b. 1845), Jesse (b. 1847), Caroline (b. 1849), Henry (b. 1854), M. L./M. Louisa? (b. 1856), Susan (b. 1858), and Castor/Esther or Hester? (b. 1860). - - - In 1853 he gave power of attorney to Felix S. Fox of Lexington County, S.C., to transfer his interest in certain lands which were part of the estate of Jesse Fox. - (Deed Book "S", p. 334.) - - - A letter written by Howell Carter (son of General A. G. Carter, C.S.A.), on 25 September 1914, recites the following concerning Daniel Jesse Fox. - "On one occasion (in October or November 1865) I drove up to a splendid home-looking place on one of those beautiful ridges of Alabama and asked a gentleman, who was sitting in his office close to the residence, if I could get some fodder or forage of some kind for our horses and mules.  He said that he regretted he could not furnish me, as he had hauled up from his plantation only small quantities at a time for his saddle and carriage horses.  Then he said, 'Where are you from?'  'Louisiana', I replied. 'What part of the State?'  'About five miles from Port Hudson.'  'Is your name Carter?' 'It is.' 'Son of General A. G. Carter?'  As I replied affirmatively, he said, 'Young man, let me shake your hand and say to you that you can get all the corn and fodder I have in my cribs here.  My boy, my nephew (Colonel Isaiah G. W. Steedman) was reared right here and studied medicine here in my office; and all the letters I ever got from him, while a soldier boy at Port Hudson, had much to say about General Carter and his family; and now I am delighted to think that the whole family can have the opportunity of spending at least one night with me.'  No one could have treated people nicer than Dr. Fox treated us, but we had too far to travel to stop with anyone, so after my father and other members of the family spent about an hour with him, we moved on." - - - The Carter family went to Georgia as refugees after the surrender of Port Hudson, in 1863; and the meeting with Dr. Fox took place while they were returning  to the family plantation near Port Hudson, La.

	5.  Lucretia (b. 11 January 1814; d. 13 March 1862). - She married, in 1830, Anderson Steedman (b. 21 August 1808; d. 1 October 1869) and became the mother of (Steedman children) - John Marcellus (b. 18 September 1833), Elliott Vincent (b. 19 March 1836), Jane Adella (b. 19 May 1838), Zenovia Ann (b. 20 September 1840), Amanda Florella (b. 16 December 1845), and Ellen (b. 1849). - (Family Records; Federal Census Records, 1830 through 1860, for Lexington County, S.C.) - - - On 23 February 1853 she and her husband deeded to the purchasers their interest in certain lands which were part of the estate of Jesse Fox. -(Deed Book "S", pp. 151, 159, and 337.) -- (See Steedman Family.)
